# brAInwav Historical Test Metrics — 2025-10-05

These artifacts capture intermediate coverage and quality-gate outputs produced during the October 2025
documentation and structure compliance sweep for brAInwav Cortex-OS. They have been relocated from the
root `test-temp/` folder to ensure ongoing Structure Guard compliance.

Contents:

- `quality_gate.json` — Historical summary of the smart test gate execution.
- `metrics/coverage.json` — Supporting coverage metrics captured from the same run.

Retain future transient QA outputs under `reports/historical/test-metrics/` or prune them once the
corresponding investigations conclude.
