# Security Scan Analysis and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After running a comprehensive security scan using Semgrep with OWASP Top 10 rules, 64 potential security issues were identified. However, **most are false positives** from test files and internal service communication.

## Issue Breakdown

### 1. Command Injection Issues (13 findings)
**Status**: Mostly false positives
- Most findings are in Python files using `subprocess.run()` with hardcoded commands
- Files flagged:
  - `apps/cortex-py/src/cortex_py/thermal.py` - Safe (hardcoded pmset command)
  - `apps/cortex-py/src/cortex_py/thermal_monitor.py` - Safe (hardcoded which command)
  - `docker/gpl-tools/gpl_service.py` - Safe (uses shell=False)
  - `libs/python/safe_subprocess/safe_subprocess.py` - Safe (controlled subprocess wrapper)

**Fixed**:
- ✅ `packages/commands/src/adapters.ts` - Changed from `exec()` to `execFile()` for git command

### 2. Code Injection Issues (2 findings)
**Status**: Fixed
- ✅ `packages/commands/src/adapters.ts` - Replaced unsafe `exec()` with `execFile()`

### 3. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Issues (15 findings)
**Status**: Mostly false positives
- Most are in test files using localhost/internal URLs
- Production files using localhost:
  - `packages/prp-runner/src/lib/model-selector.ts` - Safe (localhost:11434)
  - `scripts/smoke-healthz.mjs` - Safe (dynamic localhost)
  - `packages/agents/test-endpoint.js` - Safe (localhost:3001)

## Real Security Concerns

### Low Priority
- **Test file SSRF**: While flagged, these pose no real risk as they're in test environments
- **Internal service communication**: Using localhost/internal URLs is acceptable for microservices

### Recommendations

1. **No immediate action required** for most findings
2. **Consider adding URL validation** for any future user-facing HTTP requests
3. **Document security decisions** for localhost/internal service communication
4. **Set up security scanning exclusions** for test files and known safe patterns

## Next Steps

1. Update `.semgrep` configuration to exclude test files from certain rules
2. Add inline comments to document why certain patterns are safe
3. Consider implementing URL allowlist for any external HTTP requests
4. Regular security scans to catch new vulnerabilities

## False Positive Management

To reduce noise in future scans, consider:
```yaml
# In .semgrep/config.yaml
rules:
  - id: exclude-test-files
    paths:
      - "**/*.test.*"
      - "**/tests/**"
    pattern: "command_injection"
    severity: INFO
```

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW - Most findings are false positives from test/internal code.
