## Objective

Assess the History Store persistence adapters (file, SQLite, PostgreSQL) to identify bottlenecks affecting transcript ingestion, replay latency, and checkpoint durability, and propose performance-focused remediation options aligned with Cortex-OS governance.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/history-store/src/index.ts`, `packages/history-store/src/adapters/*.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Factory creates three adapters. File adapter persists JSONL files per session, SQLite adapter uses `better-sqlite3` with synchronous statements, and PostgreSQL adapter expects an injected client for SQL access.
- **Limitations**:
  - File adapter reads entire files into memory on `stream`, performs `mkdir` per append, and serializes writes without file locks, creating I/O hotspots for long sessions and concurrent readers.
  - SQLite adapter executes synchronous `better-sqlite3` statements inside async methods, so large writes and reads block the Node.js event loop; the range query uses `COALESCE` around bounds and lacks indices, forcing table scans as history grows.
  - PostgreSQL adapter issues single-row inserts and range queries with `COALESCE` wrappers, preventing index usage, omitting pagination beyond a simple limit, and re-parsing JSON payloads per row without column projection controls.

### Related Components
- **packages/asbr**: consumes history checkpoints during workflow resume, so slow `getCheckpoint` calls extend orchestration tail latency.
- **packages/agents**: master agent dispatch loops rely on rapid transcript appends; blocking adapters reduce throughput during fan-out events.

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: History snapshots are surfaced to MCP tools via connectors; adapter latency inflates MCP response time budgets and the documented 250 ms p95 target.
- **A2A Events**: A2A topics replay transcripts for audit. Unindexed range scans slow downstream analytics and block streaming to observability sinks.
- **Local Memory**: Local memory warm-start routines hydrate from checkpoints; inefficient JSON parsing and blocking calls delay agent readiness.
- **Existing Patterns**: Other packages (e.g., `packages/history-store` siblings such as logging) already adopt worker-thread batching and connection pooling patterns that can be mirrored.

## External Standards & References

### Industry Standards
1. **PostgreSQL 16 Performance Guidelines** (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/performance-tips.html)
   - **Relevance**: Advises on index-friendly query predicates and batching for high-ingest workloads.
   - **Key Requirements**: Avoid function-wrapped filter columns, leverage prepared statements, maintain autovacuum and partitioning strategies.

2. **SQLite Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Best Practices** (https://sqlite.org/wal.html)
   - **Relevance**: Details configuration to reduce writer contention in embedded deployments.
   - **Key Requirements**: Enable WAL mode, tune synchronous level, checkpoint regularly, and batch transactions to amortize fsync costs.

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Node.js Persistence**: Favor async, non-blocking adapters or offload synchronous drivers to worker threads to maintain event-loop responsiveness.
  - Source: Node.js Performance Best Practices 2025 report.
  - Application: Wrap `better-sqlite3` access behind `Piscina` workers or migrate to async drivers when running inside MCP request handlers.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Batched Pipeline with Worker Offload

**Description**: Buffer envelopes per adapter and flush in configurable batches using worker threads (Piscina) for JSON serialization and driver execution.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Reduces event-loop blocking for SQLite by executing synchronous calls off-thread.
- ✅ Batching amortizes fsync overhead for both SQLite and file adapters.
- ✅ Provides common instrumentation hooks for throughput metrics.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires shared buffer coordination and backpressure handling.
- ❌ Introduces ordering complexity when failures occur mid-batch.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Aligns with Constitution requirement for observable, deterministic workflows via structured telemetry.
- Minimal impact on MCP/A2A schemas because storage contract remains unchanged.
- Requires security review for worker pools but maintains data locality.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium.

---

### Option 2: Storage-Specific Optimizations

**Description**: Keep adapter interfaces but optimize each backend individually (e.g., SQLite prepared transactions, PostgreSQL partitioned tables, file streaming readers).

**Pros**:
- ✅ Targets known hotspots (COALESCE filters, missing indexes, per-append mkdir) without architectural overhaul.
- ✅ Allows incremental rollout per deployment by toggling adapter config.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Heterogeneous code paths increase maintenance burden.
- ❌ Gains limited if workload shifts between adapters frequently.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Straightforward to justify under existing governance with localized risk.
- Minimal impact on MCP/A2A interfaces.

**Implementation Effort**: Low to Medium.

---

### Option 3: Streaming Event Log Service

**Description**: Replace adapters with a dedicated gRPC/HTTP event log service backed by append-only storage (e.g., Kafka-compatible or DuckDB Parquet segments) accessed through MCP gateways.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Scales horizontally with backpressure-aware consumers.
- ✅ Enables unified indexing and retention policies across ecosystems.
- ✅ Simplifies cross-agent replay with consistent streaming semantics.

**Cons**:
- ❌ High upfront effort and operational complexity.
- ❌ Requires new deployment surface and governance approvals.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Needs Constitution amendment for new service class and frontier exposure.
- Security/privacy considerations around multi-tenant history retention.

**Implementation Effort**: High.

## Comparative Analysis

| Criteria | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Performance** | High throughput via batching | Moderate improvement | Potentially highest but dependent on infra |
| **Security** | Requires worker sandboxing | Minimal change | New surface increases risk |
| **Maintainability** | Medium (shared buffers) | High (localized tweaks) | Low initially (new service) |
| **brAInwav Fit** | Strong (leverages existing runtime) | Strong | Needs governance update |
| **Community Support** | Moderate (Piscina ecosystem) | Strong (native DB features) | Variable |
| **License Compatibility** | MIT-friendly | Native licenses | Depends on selected service |

## Recommended Approach

Adopt **Option 1** as the primary remediation, front-loaded with Option 2’s query/index fixes to capture immediate wins. This pairs adapter-neutral batching with backend-specific tuning, keeping migrations incremental while unlocking event-loop headroom for MCP traffic.

## Implementation Considerations

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "piscina": "^4.5.1"
  }
}
```

**License Verification Required**:
- [ ] `piscina` - MIT - ✅ Compatible

### Configuration Changes
- **File**: `packages/history-store/package.json`
  - **Changes**: Add worker bootstrap scripts and expose batching configuration via `exports`.
- **File**: `packages/history-store/src/adapters/sqlite.ts`
  - **Changes**: Introduce prepared transaction batching, add indexes on `(session_id, occurred_at)`.
- **File**: `packages/history-store/src/adapters/postgres.ts`
  - **Changes**: Replace `COALESCE` filters with `($2 IS NULL OR occurred_at >= $2)` style predicates, add configurable fetch size, and leverage prepared statements.

### Database Schema Changes
- **Migration Required**: Yes (PostgreSQL deployments)
- **Impact**: Add composite indexes to `history_events(session_id, occurred_at)` and `history_checkpoints(session_id)`; optional table partitioning by session prefix for hot shards.

### Breaking Changes
- **API Changes**: None expected for public interface.
- **Migration Path**: Rolling deploy with adapter-level feature flags; backfill indexes online using `CONCURRENTLY`.
