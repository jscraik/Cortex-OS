## Objective

Assess the Cortex-OS Proof Artifacts ecosystem to surface current throughput, latency, and resource bottlenecks across library APIs, trust root management, and CLI tooling, and recommend performance improvements that align with brAInwav governance.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/proof-artifacts/src/createProof.ts`
  - **Current Approach**: Builds envelopes synchronously, compiling Ajv validators at module load and performing blocking `readFileSync` hash calculations for artifacts and optional bundles.
  - **Limitations**: Hashing large artifacts serially blocks the Node event loop, and cloning context via `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` duplicates payloads without streaming for large public contexts.
- **Location**: `packages/proof-artifacts/src/verifyProof.ts`
  - **Current Approach**: Recreates Ajv instance per process, then verifies artifact, bundle, and evidence hashes via `readFileSync`, iterating sequentially.
  - **Limitations**: Sequential verification multiplies latency on directories with many bundle files; synchronous file access prevents IO overlap and lacks caching for repeated proofs.
- **Location**: `packages/proof-artifacts/src/cli/cortex-proofs.ts`
  - **Current Approach**: CLI commands traverse directories recursively using synchronous `readdirSync`, load/write envelopes with blocking IO, and sign proofs by awaiting `Promise.all` over attestations after reading entire files into memory.
  - **Limitations**: Recursion without concurrency limits throughput when scanning large workspaces; `Promise.all` still performs heavy JSON parsing synchronously per file, and repeated Ajv compilation in child imports increases warm-up time for each CLI invocation.

### Related Components
- **Component 1**: `packages/proof-artifacts/tests/cli` — exercises CLI flows but relies on fixture-sized payloads, masking hot path contention for multi-gigabyte artifact directories.
- **Component 2**: `packages/cbom` & `packages/security` — downstream consumers depend on timely attestation verification; proof latency propagates into SBOM validation windows and policy gates, magnifying blocking IO penalties.

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: Proof envelopes feed ASBR admission policies through MCP resources; delays in trust root refreshes can stall agent dispatch chains if cached bundles expire.
- **A2A Events**: Signed proof notifications emit across the security bus; synchronous CLI execution can backlog the outbox when multiple builds attempt signing simultaneously.
- **Local Memory**: Proof metadata is persisted into local memory stores for traceability; inefficient hashing and serialization inflate ingestion times and memory snapshot sizes.
- **Existing Patterns**: Other cryptographic packages (e.g., `packages/cortex-sec`) have migrated to worker-thread hashing and shared Ajv validators, demonstrating reusable approaches for this domain.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Worker-Thread Hashing & Streaming IO

**Description**: Introduce a shared worker pool to process artifact, bundle, and evidence hashing tasks using `node:crypto` stream-based hashing (e.g., `createHash` with pipeline) for large files, while migrating read paths to `createReadStream` pipelines. For small in-memory buffers, `crypto.subtle.digest` may be used, but it is not suitable for large payloads.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Removes long synchronous IO from main thread, improving CLI responsiveness.
- ✅ Enables bounded parallelism across bundle files, reducing total verification time for large proofs.
- ✅ Aligns with existing worker pool implementations in security packages, easing adoption.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires additional infrastructure (worker management, graceful shutdown hooks).
- ❌ Stream-based hashing complicates error propagation and test harness updates.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Preserves constitution mandates via named exports and ≤40-line worker dispatch helpers.
- Integrates with MCP/A2A pipelines by exposing async APIs without altering contracts.
- Requires security review to ensure no sensitive material leaves process boundaries.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium.

---

### Option 2: Incremental Trust Root & Validator Cache Layer

**Description**: Build a singleton trust root manager that memoizes Ajv validators and Sigstore bundles with TTL enforcement, refreshed asynchronously via background tasks triggered on demand.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Cuts cold-start latency by reusing compiled schemas and trust materials between CLI invocations.
- ✅ Avoids redundant network fetches, maintaining Sigstore bundle freshness within SLA.
- ✅ Minimal invasive changes; primarily dependency injection and caching wrappers.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires careful invalidation to avoid stale trust bundles violating governance.
- ❌ Shared caches must respect per-process isolation in multi-tenant deployments.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Supports local-first design by persisting caches under workspace directories.
- Maintains MCP contract semantics because envelope structure remains unchanged.
- Needs additional telemetry to audit cache hit/miss ratios per governance requirements.

**Implementation Effort**: Low.

---

### Option 3: CLI Pipeline Refactor with Batched Operations

**Description**: Rework `cortex-proofs` CLI to stream directory traversal asynchronously, queue signing/verification tasks, and introduce progress instrumentation to surface throughput metrics.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Reduces peak memory by avoiding entire-directory materialization.
- ✅ Enables concurrency control (e.g., batch size, rate limits) to protect downstream services.
- ✅ Provides richer telemetry for observability and compliance.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Significant refactor of CLI module and tests.
- ❌ Potential breaking changes to CLI output ordering requiring documentation updates.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Must preserve brAInwav-branded logs and compatibility with automation scripts.
- Requires adherence to CLI accessibility flags (`--plain`) when adding progress output.
- Integration with security pipelines demands deterministic exit codes.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium-High.

## Comparative Analysis

| Criteria | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Performance** | High throughput gains for hashing-heavy workloads | Moderate cold-start reduction | High scalability for bulk CLI runs |
| **Security** | Requires review of worker boundaries | Preserves current security posture | Introduces new async paths needing audit |
| **Maintainability** | Moderate (shared worker utilities) | High (small surface area) | Moderate (larger CLI refactor) |
| **brAInwav Fit** | Strong alignment with existing security patterns | Excellent (cache reuse consistent with governance) | Good but needs extra documentation |
| **Community Support** | Strong Node worker ecosystem | Established caching patterns | Requires internal support |
| **License Compatibility** | MIT | ISC / MIT | MIT |

## Recommended Approach

**Selected**: Option 2 - Incremental Trust Root & Validator Cache Layer

**Rationale**:
- Meets brAInwav Constitution performance mandates with minimal surface change: reusing Ajv validators and trust materials addresses the largest observed cold-start bottlenecks without altering proof schema contracts.
- Technical advantages include deterministic latency improvements for both library consumers and the CLI, while deferring heavier worker pool adoption until profiling confirms IO contention beyond caching gains.
- Risk mitigation is straightforward—cache TTLs can be tuned and guarded by checksum validation, and observability hooks can emit cache metrics to the existing logging pipeline.
- Aligns with existing architecture by sharing singletons exposed via `getDefaultTrustMaterial` and future `getProofValidator` helpers, preserving named exports and TypeScript boundaries.

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Defers maximal throughput improvements from worker-thread hashing; large artifacts may still saturate the main thread.
- Introduces cache invalidation complexity that requires additional telemetry and governance sign-off.

## Constraints & Considerations

### brAInwav-Specific Constraints
- ✅ **Local-First**: Caches must store trust bundles under workspace-scoped directories with explicit retention policies.
- ✅ **Zero Exfiltration**: Trust root refreshers operate against approved Sigstore endpoints only; no new telemetry leaks.
- ✅ **Named Exports**: Shared validators and managers are exported explicitly from `src/index.ts` without default exports.
- ✅ **Function Size**: New helper factories should stay under 40 lines, following `createProofEnvelope` patterns.
- ✅ **Branding**: CLI output continues to include `brAInwav` prefixes for all status logs.

### Technical Constraints
- Nx executor integration requires caching layer to respect `pnpm --filter` boundaries and avoid cross-package pollution.
- Node 20+ runtime is mandated; worker pools and `stream/promises` utilities must degrade gracefully if unavailable.
- Performance goals: maintain ≤250 ms p95 signing latency and ≤800 ms cold start per package manifest (AGENTS §0).
- Multi-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows) demands filesystem-safe cache paths and locking strategies.

### Security Constraints
- Authentication: Sigstore identity tokens remain scoped per invocation; caches must never persist tokens on disk.
- Data encryption: Optional disk cache encryption using OS keyrings should be evaluated to protect trust bundles.
- Audit logging: Cache hits/misses and refresh outcomes must flow into Cortex logging with correlation IDs.
- Compliance: SLSA provenance requirements demand verifiable cache integrity checksums logged for audits.

### Integration Constraints
- Observability: Emit metrics compatible with `packages/observability` (e.g., `proof_artifacts.cache.hit_count`).
- Deployment: Any new background refresh service must integrate with existing PM2/systemd scripts documented in `docs/runbooks/`.
- Testing: Update Vitest suites to cover cache warm/cold paths without breaching coverage thresholds (≥95% changed lines).
- Tooling: Ensure CLI retains compatibility with CI workflows invoked via `pnpm cortex-proofs` scripts.

## Implementation Roadmap & Next Steps

1. **Validator & Trust Cache Refactor (Week 1)**
   - Extract Ajv validator initialization into `getProofEnvelopeValidator()` singleton.
   - Introduce disk-backed trust bundle cache with TTL and checksum validation.
   - Add structured logging for cache hits/misses (brand `brAInwav`).
2. **Async Refresh & Telemetry (Week 2)**
   - Implement background refresh triggered on cache miss, using mutex to serialize network fetches.
   - Publish metrics to observability stack and update runbooks with troubleshooting steps.
3. **CLI Streaming Enhancements (Week 3, optional)**
   - Replace synchronous directory traversal with async generator, enabling progressive discovery.
   - Add `--concurrency` flag with sensible default (e.g., 4) for signing operations.
4. **Worker Pool Pilot (Week 4+, gated)**
   - Prototype worker-thread hashing for large artifacts; run benchmarks to validate ROI.
   - Document results and, if favorable, integrate behind feature flag for staged rollout.

## Open Questions

- What cache persistence window satisfies security governance without breaching freshness requirements for Sigstore bundles?
- Do downstream packages (CBOM, security) require explicit hooks to observe cache status, or is central logging sufficient?
- Should worker-thread hashing be prioritized sooner to unblock large binary attestation pipelines (>2 GB artifacts)?

---

## Appendix: Benchmark Considerations

- Establish baseline CLI timings for create/verify/sign commands on representative artifact sets (1 GB+, 200+ bundle files).
- Capture Node.js heap/memory snapshots before and after cache introduction to ensure sub-256 MB footprint (AGENTS performance budget).
- Record Sigstore network latency metrics with and without keep-alive pooling to validate <250 ms p95 SLA.
