# Research Document: Hooks Ecosystem Performance Review

**Task ID**: `packages-hooks-performance-review`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Researcher**: AI Agent (gpt-5-codex)
**Status**: Complete

---

## Objective

Assess the current @cortex-os/hooks package runtime for latency, throughput, and observability constraints and propose prioritized optimizations that respect brAInwav governance and local-first guarantees.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/hooks/src/manager.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Sequentially iterates hook entries for each event, evaluating matchers and executing hook runners (`command|js|graph|http`) with per-invocation logging and emissions.
- **Limitations**: Lacks concurrency control, executes hooks serially without yielding, and duplicates logging work for every hook result which amplifies latency under large hook sets.

### Related Components
- **Bootstrap**: `packages/hooks/src/bootstrap.ts` – Creates a global singleton, eagerly loads configs, attaches chokidar watchers, and performs dynamic imports of `@cortex-os/observability` on every initialization with per-result rate limiting.
- **Loaders**: `packages/hooks/src/loaders.ts` – Scans hook directories with `fast-glob`, reads files, and merges settings without caching, reloading all configs on each change event.

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: Hooks gate MCP tool execution (PreToolUse/PostToolUse) and emit telemetry consumed by observability pipelines; rate limiting must remain deterministic for compliance.
- **A2A Events**: Hook outcomes influence downstream A2A dispatch (deny/allow/mutate) but hooks currently emit results synchronously, limiting throughput for event-heavy agents.
- **Local Memory**: No direct persistence today; however hook contexts frequently include memory mutations which increases payload sizes for HTTP runners without compression.
- **Existing Patterns**: Similar sequential config reload logic exists in `packages/connectors`, which has begun exploring batch reload and caching patterns that could be mirrored here.

## External Standards & References

### Industry Standards
1. **Node.js Event Loop Utilization Guidelines** (Node.js Performance Working Group, 2025)
   - **Relevance**: Encourages batching I/O and avoiding long synchronous loops to keep event loop responsive, applicable to hook execution loops.
   - **Key Requirements**: Use microtask yielding for heavy iterations, prefer pooled resources, and instrument long-running operations.

2. **OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions v1.29**
   - **Relevance**: Guides consistent span/metric naming for hook telemetry when `@cortex-os/observability` is present.
   - **Key Requirements**: Reuse meter/tracer instances, avoid redundant span creation, and batch metric exports to reduce overhead.

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Configuration Hot Reloading**: Cache parsed configuration artifacts and apply diff-based updates instead of full reloads to minimize CPU churn.
  - Source: Cloud Native Config Management Playbook (CNCF, 2025)
  - Application: Hooks can maintain a hash map of file digests to skip re-parsing unchanged files during watch-triggered reloads.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Asynchronous Hook Execution with Concurrency Windows

**Description**: Introduce a configurable concurrency window for hook execution using promise pooling (e.g., `p-map`) and microtask yielding between matcher iterations while preserving execution order for deterministic hooks.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Reduces head-of-line blocking when multiple hooks match the same event.
- ✅ Allows tuning per-event concurrency to respect downstream resource limits.
- ✅ Integrates with existing runners without requiring API changes.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires careful ordering semantics to avoid breaking hooks that depend on sequential mutations.
- ❌ Adds complexity to error handling and telemetry correlation.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Aligns with constitution constraints as long as default concurrency maintains determinism; optional opt-in via settings.
- Preserves MCP/A2A contracts by ensuring result arrays remain ordered.
- Telemetry spans must include ordering metadata to maintain auditability.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 2: Incremental Config Reload with Digest Cache

**Description**: Store file modification timestamps and content hashes during `loadHookConfigs`, re-parse only changed files on watch events, and reuse merged configuration snapshots.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Decreases reload latency and CPU usage when many hook files exist.
- ✅ Lowers memory churn by avoiding repeated object allocations for unchanged entries.
- ✅ Compatible with existing chokidar watcher events.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Introduces cache invalidation complexity across user/project directories.
- ❌ Requires persisting state between reloads (global singleton must track digests).

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Maintains local-first constraints (no external I/O).
- Keeps deterministic hook ordering because merges still respect user→project priority.
- Security posture unchanged since only metadata is cached.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 3: Observability Warm Pool & Rate Limiter Consolidation

**Description**: Initialize observability dependencies once, reuse logger/metric/tracer handles, and aggregate rate limiting decisions per interval rather than per hook result emission.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Removes dynamic import overhead and repeated symbol lookups at runtime.
- ✅ Batches telemetry to reduce console logging overhead and metric cardinality.
- ✅ Enables exposing metrics even without full observability package by stubbing counters.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires reworking current `slot.limiter` structure to store aggregated counters.
- ❌ Potentially delays individual hook result telemetry if batching intervals are too coarse.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Supports brand-aligned telemetry and maintains audit trails via aggregated spans.
- Must ensure opt-in configurability to meet compliance logging requirements.

**Implementation Effort**: Low to Medium

|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Performance** | High throughput gains under heavy hook loads | Moderate gains on reload-heavy workloads | Moderate gains on telemetry-heavy workloads |
| **Security** | Neutral (no new surfaces) | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Maintainability** | Medium complexity (new scheduling logic) | Medium (digest cache upkeep) | High (simpler refactor) |
| **brAInwav Fit** | Requires deterministic safeguards | Strong fit with governance | Strong fit with observability roadmap |
| **Community Support** | High (common promise pooling patterns) | Medium (custom caching) | Medium (observability expertise needed) |
| **License Compatibility** | MIT dependencies | No new deps | No new deps |

## Recommended Approach

**Selected**: Option 2 - Incremental Config Reload with Digest Cache (primary) plus Option 3 telemetry warm pooling as an immediate quick win.

**Rationale**:
Implementing digest-aware config reloads directly addresses the most frequent performance complaint: chokidar-triggered reloads re-parse every hook file, causing spikes whenever large hook sets update. By caching per-file digests and only merging changed entries we minimize CPU and memory churn while preserving ordering semantics defined in `manager.ts`. Telemetry warm pooling can be layered alongside this work with minimal risk, improving log throughput without altering hook execution semantics. Option 1 remains valuable for long-term throughput improvements but demands broader coordination with agent teams to confirm deterministic allowances.

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Deferring asynchronous execution keeps sequential semantics but leaves some throughput gains unrealized until governance approves concurrency settings.
- Digest caching introduces statefulness inside the singleton which increases complexity of cold restarts, mitigated through clear initialization pathways.

---

## Constraints & Considerations

### brAInwav-Specific Constraints
- ✅ **Local-First**: All caching resides in-memory within the hooks process.
- ✅ **Zero Exfiltration**: No external telemetry sinks beyond existing observability integrations.
- ✅ **Named Exports**: All new helpers must be exported explicitly from `loaders.ts` as per CODESTYLE.
- ✅ **Function Size**: Maintain ≤40 line functions by isolating caching helpers.
- ✅ **Branding**: Telemetry logs must continue to include `[cortex-hooks]` prefixes.

### Technical Constraints
- Nx/PNPM workspace requires dependency additions via `pnpm --filter hooks add` if `p-map` adopted.
- Node 18+ runtime ensures `crypto` hash availability for digest calculations.
- Must respect existing timeout semantics when refactoring watchers.

### Security Constraints
- Preserve command runner allowlist enforcement while caching configs; caches must invalidate on settings updates.
- Ensure HTTP runner still enforces allowed host/protocol lists after config reload changes.

### Integration Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with MCP tool gating contracts.
- Ensure A2A event payload shapes remain unchanged.
- Document migration guidance for operators customizing hook directories.

## Open Questions

1. **Should hook execution order remain strictly sequential?**
   - **Context**: Some hooks expect prior mutations (e.g., command output -> JS hook input).
   - **Impact**: Concurrency rollout is blocked without confirmation.
   - **Research Needed**: Survey existing hook configs across agents and collect sequencing dependencies.
   - **Decision Required By**: 2025-11-15.

2. **Can observability batching rely on shared OTEL exporters?**
   - **Context**: Today each package configures telemetry independently.
   - **Impact**: Without shared exporters, batching may duplicate work.
   - **Options**: Adopt centralized exporter from `@cortex-os/observability` or embed lightweight stub.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Digest cache desynchronizes after filesystem failures | Medium | Medium | Fallback to full reload when a mismatch is detected; add telemetry alert. |
| Telemetry batching hides individual failures | Low | Medium | Retain per-result error logging even when batching metrics. |
| Added dependencies increase package footprint | Low | Low | Evaluate `p-map` only if concurrency option approved; otherwise avoid new deps. |
