**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Researcher**: AI Agent
**Status**: Complete

## Objective

Assess current performance characteristics of the `@cortex-os/protocol` package and its dependents, identify bottlenecks in schema validation and connector manifest handling, and propose actionable optimization strategies that preserve brAInwav governance requirements.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/protocol/src/connectors/service-map.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Connector manifests are validated with Zod schemas and canonicalized by recursively sorting object keys and arrays before generating HMAC signatures for verification. Each verification recomputes canonical JSON and allocates intermediate objects on every call.
- **Limitations**: Canonicalization performs deep copies without structural sharing, resulting in repeated allocations for large manifests. Signature verification duplicates buffers and performs synchronous crypto work on the event loop for every request, increasing latency under load.

- **Location**: `packages/protocol/src/schemas.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Runtime contracts rely on large Zod discriminated unions and nested lazy schemas to validate agent plans, stream events, and budgets. Consumers (agents, stream protocol, connectors) parse every payload through these schemas at runtime.
- **Limitations**: Repeated `parse` invocations rebuild coercion graphs and traverse the entire structure, which becomes expensive for streaming traffic (token/status events) and deeply nested plans. The lack of schema compilation or caching introduces avoidable CPU overhead.

### Related Components
- **Component 1**: `packages/agents/src/connectors/service-map-client.ts` — Fetches manifests, invokes `serviceMapResponseSchema.parse`, and verifies signatures synchronously before dispatching connector updates. Any latency in schema validation or canonicalization directly delays agent connector refresh cycles.
- **Component 2**: `packages/stream-protocol/src/ws.ts` — Uses `StreamEventSchema` to validate every WebSocket event, inheriting the heavy discriminated union parsing path from the protocol package.

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: MCP surfaces depend on `StreamEventSchema` and `ToolResultSchema` to gate outbound traffic. Performance regressions in schema parsing can throttle SSE/WS delivery and inflate MCP latency budgets.
- **A2A Events**: Agents publish A2A envelopes conforming to `EnvelopeSchema`; synchronous validation adds pressure to the shared event loop during bursty orchestrations.
- **Local Memory**: Task and plan schemas are used to persist context snapshots; slow validation increases persistence time and risks breaching local-first latency SLOs.
- **Existing Patterns**: Other ecosystem reviews already recommend adaptive dispatch and batching; protocol performance is prerequisite because every downstream domain relies on these schemas for contract enforcement.

## External Standards & References

### Industry Standards
1. **RFC 8785 — JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)** (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785)
   - **Relevance**: Provides a standardized, deterministic canonicalization algorithm that avoids ad-hoc sort implementations.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Lexicographic ordering of object keys with UTF-8 byte comparison
     - Deterministic number formatting without trailing zeros
     - UTF-8 based string normalization

2. **NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev.5 — Recommendation for Key Management**
   - **Relevance**: Guides HMAC key lifetimes and rotation strategy, informing manifest signature caching and refresh intervals.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Limit secret exposure time, enforce rotation schedules
     - Use approved hash functions (SHA-256) with sufficient key entropy

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Node.js Validation Performance**: Prefer precompiled validation functions (e.g., via Zod `.transformer` caching or switching to runtime code generation) to reduce per-request overhead. Source: Node.js Performance Best Practices WG 2025-07 bulletin.
  - **Application**: Compile frequently used schemas once during module initialization and reuse optimized functions during stream validation.
- **Event Loop Protection**: Offload CPU-bound crypto and parsing to worker threads when sustained throughput is required. Source: OpenJS Foundation guidance on `worker_threads` adoption (2025).
  - **Application**: Move manifest canonicalization and signature verification into pooled workers to shield orchestrator latency budgets.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Schema Compiler Migration

**Description**: Adopt `@sinclair/typebox` with the compiler to generate optimized validation functions for hot path schemas (stream events, plans, envelopes) while maintaining TypeScript type parity.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Generates highly optimized validators that avoid per-call AST traversal.
- ✅ Supports shared schema definitions with static type inference similar to Zod.
- ✅ Compatible with JSON Schema tooling, easing contract documentation.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires a coordinated migration of existing Zod schemas and tests.
- ❌ Some advanced Zod refinements may need manual porting or fallback wrappers.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Aligns with constitution emphasis on deterministic contracts and maintainable code.
- Improves MCP/A2A latency without altering public payloads.
- Requires review to ensure zero data exfiltration and consistent error semantics.

**Implementation Effort**: High

---

### Option 2: Zod Precompilation + Shared Pipelines

**Description**: Keep Zod but leverage `.transformer` or `zod-to-json-schema` to precompile parse pipelines during module load, caching them for reuse. Introduce memoization for canonicalization results keyed by manifest ULIDs.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Minimal ecosystem disruption; dependent packages retain existing imports.
- ✅ Allows incremental optimization focused on hottest schemas.
- ✅ Memoization reduces redundant canonicalization for unchanged manifests.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Still bound by Zod's runtime overhead relative to compiled validators.
- ❌ Memoization adds cache invalidation complexity and memory usage.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Maintains contract compatibility and error shapes used across packages.
- Cache layer must respect local-first storage and avoid persistent secrets.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 3: Worker-Thread Crypto Offload

**Description**: Move `canonicalizeServiceMapPayload` and HMAC verification into a worker pool using `worker_threads` to parallelize CPU-heavy tasks and keep the main loop responsive.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Shields orchestrator loop from blocking crypto operations.
- ✅ Scales with core count, improving throughput under concurrent manifest refreshes.
- ✅ Implementation isolated to connector utilities with minimal API change.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Adds operational complexity (pool sizing, lifecycle management).
- ❌ Worker startup adds cold-start latency unless pools are warmed.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Supports constitution goals around predictable latency and resilience.
- Requires secure key handling within workers but stays local-first.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

## Recommended Approach

**Selected**: Option 2 - Zod Precompilation + Shared Pipelines

**Rationale**:
- Preserves existing public exports and TypeScript types consumed across Cortex-OS, reducing coordination risk with downstream packages (agents, stream protocol, connectors).【F:packages/agents/src/connectors/service-map-client.ts†L1-L85】【F:packages/stream-protocol/src/ws.ts†L1-L80】
- Allows targeted optimization of the hottest schemas (StreamEvent, ToolResult, Envelope) by caching compiled pipelines and reusing them across event bursts, improving latency without a wholesale rewrite.【F:packages/protocol/src/schemas.ts†L1-L142】
- Memoizing canonicalized payloads by `id`/`generatedAt` eliminates redundant deep sorts for unchanged manifests while keeping signature verification deterministic.【F:packages/protocol/src/connectors/service-map.ts†L55-L93】

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Continue to bear some Zod runtime overhead versus a full compiler migration.
- Introduce cache invalidation paths that must be carefully tested to avoid stale manifests.

## Constraints & Considerations

### brAInwav-Specific Constraints
- ✅ **Local-First**: Caches must live in-memory per process without remote persistence.
- ✅ **Zero Exfiltration**: No manifest data should leave the node during optimization.
- ✅ **Named Exports**: Maintain existing named exports from `src/index.ts` to avoid breaking dependents.【F:packages/protocol/src/index.ts†L1-L44】
- ✅ **Function Size**: Ensure helper functions introduced for caching stay within ≤40 line guideline.
- ✅ **Branding**: Manifest validation continues to enforce `brand: 'brAInwav'` metadata, preserving governance requirements.【F:packages/protocol/src/connectors/service-map.ts†L24-L42】

### Technical Constraints
- Nx workspace tooling expects TypeScript source co-located with Zod schemas; migration must keep TypeScript build intact.
- Coverage thresholds (92% global, 95% changed) require comprehensive unit tests for cache paths.
- Target latency budgets: p95 ≤ 250 ms for manifest fetch and validation per package instructions.
- Need compatibility across Node 20+ runtime environments used by Cortex-OS deployments.

### Security Constraints
- HMAC keys handled within caching/worker layers must respect rotation policies informed by NIST guidance.
- Validation errors should remain opaque enough to avoid leaking schema details.
- Audit logging should record cache hits/misses without exposing secrets.

### Integration Constraints
- Agents and stream-protocol packages depend on current error classes; optimization must retain thrown error types to avoid regression in telemetry pipelines.【F:packages/agents/src/connectors/service-map-client.ts†L17-L76】
- Observability hooks should emit metrics for cache effectiveness and worker utilization to feed existing logging infrastructure.
- Rollout requires coordination with registry refresh cadence to validate performance improvements under real load.

## Open Questions

1. Should protocol schemas expose both Zod and compiled validator interfaces to ease gradual migration toward TypeBox?
2. What cache eviction policy best balances memory usage against manifest refresh frequency given TTL semantics?
3. Are there downstream consumers performing additional serialization that could reuse the canonical payload cache to avoid duplicate work?
4. Would adopting WebCrypto `crypto.subtle.importKey` unlock FIPS-aligned signature verification with acceptable performance on all supported platforms?
