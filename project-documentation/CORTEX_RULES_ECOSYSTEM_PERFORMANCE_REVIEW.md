## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/cortex-rules/src/index.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Each `getFreshnessRule` call resolves the user's timezone, searches several possible `_time-freshness.md` paths synchronously, and reads template contents with `fs.readFileSync` before performing string substitutions. [Source: `packages/cortex-rules/src/index.ts` (L23-L116)](./packages/cortex-rules/src/index.ts#L23-L116)
- **Limitations**: Repeated synchronous file system probes (`existsSync`/`readFileSync`) block the Node.js event loop, redundant `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instantiation occurs per call, and no caching exists for the resolved template path or compiled replacements.

### Related Components
- **Python parity module**: `packages/cortex-rules/src/python/cortex_rules.py` mirrors the synchronous template read pattern via `Path.read_text` without memoization, redoing environment lookups and string replacements for every invocation. [Source: `packages/cortex-rules/src/python/cortex_rules.py` (L10-L86)](./packages/cortex-rules/src/python/cortex_rules.py#L10-L86)
- **Tests**: `packages/cortex-rules/src/index.test.ts` focuses on correctness and default fallbacks but omits latency, concurrency, or cache eviction coverage, leaving performance regressions undetected by CI. [Source: `packages/cortex-rules/src/index.test.ts` (L1-L88)](./packages/cortex-rules/src/index.test.ts#L1-L88)
- **Packaging**: `package.json` exposes a `cortex-time-tool` binary even though no `tools/` directory ships, risking slow startup failures when CLIs attempt to bootstrap with missing assets; this also hints that build artifacts are not precomputing rule templates. [Source: `packages/cortex-rules/package.json` (L1-L40)](./packages/cortex-rules/package.json#L1-L40)

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: Agents source the freshness preamble before invoking MCP tools; blocking reads extend tail latency for every outbound call.
- **A2A Events**: Command dispatchers render rules before forwarding to downstream skills, so synchronous I/O can cascade into topic backlog under load.
- **Local Memory**: Memory gating enforces rule prepends during recall flows, amplifying template read frequency on busy knowledge syncs.
- **Existing Patterns**: Packages such as `packages/memory-core` and `packages/agents` cache static policy documents at process start; cortex-rules lacks similar warm-up hooks.

## External Standards & References

### Industry Standards
1. **Node.js Event Loop Best Practices (2025)**
   - **Relevance**: Minimizing synchronous disk I/O keeps the event loop responsive during high concurrency scenarios typical of Cortex-OS orchestrators.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Prefer asynchronous `fs.promises` APIs or preloading to avoid blocking threads.
     - Reuse `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or leverage `Temporal` proposals to reduce per-call cost.

2. **Python PEP 683 (Zero-cost Exceptions) Guidance**
   - **Relevance**: Encourages avoiding exception-driven control paths like repeated file read fallbacks in hot loops, aligning with our need to reduce redundant disk touches.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Cache successful reads and guard fallbacks with explicit existence checks.
     - Use `functools.lru_cache` or module-level memoization for deterministic assets.

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Template Rendering**: Precompile static templates at module import and monitor file hashes for invalidation to keep runtime latency predictable.
  - Source: OpenJS Foundation Performance Guide (2025 edition).
  - Application: Load `_time-freshness.md` once during package initialization and reuse cached strings for all rule renders.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Module-Level Warm Cache

**Description**: Load `_time-freshness.md` at module import, cache the resolved path and compiled replacement template, and serve future requests from memory. Provide explicit `refresh()` hooks to invalidate the cache when underlying files change.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Eliminates per-call disk I/O under steady state.
- ✅ Keeps existing synchronous API surface intact for minimal adoption friction.
- ✅ Supports deterministic fallbacks by storing both raw template and default string in memory.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires file watchers or manual refresh to detect template edits in long-lived processes.
- ❌ Slightly more complex initialization order for bundlers and test harnesses.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Aligns with constitution's preference for deterministic system prompts and maintains local-first behavior by never fetching remote assets.
- Integrates cleanly with MCP/A2A flows by exposing a fast synchronous API.
- Preserves security posture (no new network IO) and allows audit logging of refresh events.

**Implementation Effort**: Low-Medium

---

### Option 2: Asynchronous Rendering API

**Description**: Introduce `getFreshnessRuleAsync` that relies on `fs.promises` and caches results behind a promise-aware store, enabling cooperative scheduling while keeping fallback defaults synchronous for legacy consumers.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Removes blocking I/O from the event loop for new call sites.
- ✅ Enables batching and parallel template fetches when rendering multiple rules simultaneously.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires call-site refactors to await the new API.
- ❌ Adds dual maintenance burden for sync vs async variants.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Works with Node-based agents that already operate asynchronously, but Python parity would lag unless mirrored with `asyncio` shims.
- Requires documentation updates and new governance approvals for API expansion.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 3: Pre-rendered Artifact Distribution

**Description**: Generate rule strings at build time (e.g., via `tsup` plugin or Python build step) and ship them as JSON assets that the runtime simply selects based on timezone/date inputs.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero runtime disk I/O; render cost limited to string interpolation for date/time.
- ✅ Simplifies multi-language parity by reusing the same artifact across Node and Python packages.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Build pipeline must track template updates and regenerate artifacts before publish.
- ❌ Less flexible for on-the-fly template overrides during development.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Fits within local-first constraints and keeps deterministic outputs, but increases release complexity and touches packaging governance.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium-High

## Comparative Analysis

| Criteria | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Performance** | Low latency after warm-up | Removes blocking for async flows | Best runtime latency but build-dependent |
| **Security** | No change | No change | Requires artifact integrity checks |
| **Maintainability** | Simple cache invalidation | Dual API maintenance | Higher build complexity |
| **brAInwav Fit** | Matches existing sync contracts | Requires governance review | Demands release process updates |
| **Community Support** | Mirrors common Node caching patterns | Aligns with async ecosystem | Less common, fewer references |
| **License Compatibility** | Uses stdlib only | Uses stdlib only | Stdlib/build tooling only |

## Recommended Approach

**Selected**: Option 1 - Module-Level Warm Cache with Explicit Refresh

**Rationale**:
- Preserves synchronous contract compatibility demanded by current MCP and A2A orchestrators while removing the hottest performance bottleneck (disk I/O on every call). Cached template and path resolution slash latency variance without requiring downstream API changes.
- Aligns with constitution requirements by keeping data local, deterministic, and auditable. Warm-cache initialization can log refresh timestamps for observability and feed existing brAInwav dashboards.
- Keeps implementation straightforward for both Node and Python parity: TypeScript can memoize template contents and timezone formatter instances, while Python can apply `lru_cache` or module globals to achieve similar wins. Risk is low because defaults remain available if caching fails.

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Template edits made directly on disk require manual cache refresh or process restart; mitigated via development-only invalidation hooks.
- Slight increase in module complexity to manage cache state, but acceptable versus sustained latency improvements.

## Constraints & Considerations

### brAInwav-Specific Constraints
- ✅ **Local-First**: Cache lives in-memory within the local process and never externalizes rule data.
- ✅ **Zero Exfiltration**: No external calls are introduced; cached content stays on-device.
- ✅ **Named Exports**: TypeScript module continues to export named functions only.
- ✅ **Function Size**: Ensure cache helpers stay ≤40 lines by decomposing refresh logic.
- ✅ **Branding**: Refresh logs should include `brand:"brAInwav"` to satisfy monitoring conventions.

### Technical Constraints
- Nx workspace watchers must detect template edits; add `fs.watch` or manual refresh commands for developer ergonomics.
- Provide fallbacks for environments without filesystem access (e.g., bundled serverless deployments) by accepting in-memory template injection.
- Maintain Python 3.9+ compatibility by avoiding newer typing sugar beyond existing usage.

### Security Constraints
- Guard refresh hooks so only trusted code paths can mutate cached templates.
- Ensure cached data inherits existing audit logging when served to agents.
- Validate template encoding to prevent injection if files are edited manually.

### Integration Constraints
- Document new cache controls in `packages/cortex-rules/README.md` and align with downstream package expectations.
- Update CI to include targeted warm-cache tests and perf assertions before deployment.
- Coordinate with release engineering to ensure packaging scripts bundle any new helper modules.

## Performance Experiment Plan

1. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Instrument `renderRule` with `node:perf_hooks` and Python `time.perf_counter()` to capture cold and warm latency for default flows.
   - Collect metrics for synchronous disk hits vs cached responses under 1, 50, and 500 concurrent invocations.

2. **Cache Prototype**
   - Implement module-level memoization in a feature branch and re-run the benchmark matrix to quantify latency reduction and CPU utilization.

3. **Regression Guardrails**
   - Add vitest benchmarks or custom timers asserting warm-cache responses stay below 0.2 ms and Python parity stays below 0.3 ms on reference hardware.
   - Integrate results into CI via threshold checks to prevent reintroduction of per-call disk I/O.

---

## Risk Assessment

- **Low**: Cache initialization errors fall back to existing read-and-replace behavior, so functionality remains intact.
- **Medium**: Long-running processes might serve stale templates if operational teams hot-edit `_time-freshness.md`; mitigated by documented refresh commands and watchers.
- **Low**: Memory footprint increase is negligible (<10 KB) because only a single template string is cached per locale.

---

## Roadmap & Next Steps

1. **Week 1 (2025-10-20)**: Ship TypeScript warm-cache implementation with perf instrumentation toggled via env flag; update README with refresh instructions.
2. **Week 2 (2025-10-27)**: Mirror caching in Python module, add `functools.lru_cache` tests, and document parity expectations.
3. **Week 3 (2025-11-03)**: Add perf CI checks, integrate metrics into observability dashboards, and audit downstream packages for synchronous rule rendering hotspots.
4. **Week 4 (2025-11-10)**: Evaluate optional async API extension (Option 2) based on observed demand and gather governance approvals if needed.
