# Research Document: Cortex Structure GitHub Ecosystem Performance Review

## Objective

Document the current performance profile of the Cortex Structure GitHub package and outline optimizations that lower webhook response latency, clone overhead, and reaction throughput while respecting GitHub App constraints.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Every push, PR, and comment command handler performs a fresh `git clone --depth 1` followed by optional checkout before processing, regardless of repository size or recent clones.  
- **Limitations**:
  - Burst traffic triggers multiple concurrent clones with no throttling, introducing CPU, disk, and GitHub API pressure.
  - Push events collect the entire repository file list via `getAllFiles`, forcing recursive reads even when only a handful of files changed.  
  - PR and comment workflows recompute structure scores by re-cloning and re-validating instead of reusing prior analysis artifacts, elongating `/webhook` handling time.  

### Related Components
- **Context Analyzer** (`packages/cortex-structure-github/src/lib/context-analyzer.ts`): Performs repeated `fs.pathExists`, `fs.readJson`, and recursive `fs.readdir` scans for each command invocation, re-deriving repository metadata without caching.  
- **Auto-Fix Engine** (`packages/cortex-structure-github/src/core/auto-fix-engine.ts`): Executes fix actions sequentially and synchronously, lacking batching or concurrency controls when multiple violations are auto-fixable.  

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: No direct MCP surfaces, but webhook handlers publish GitHub reactions to emulate progressive status which can exceed GitHub rate limits under load.  
- **A2A Events**: Not currently emitting internal events; all work happens inline during webhook processing, increasing the risk of GitHub retrying events if requests exceed timeouts.
- **Local Memory**: No persistence of previous analyses; repeated scans lose opportunity to warm caches or reuse heuristics between events.

## External Standards & References

1. **GitHub App Webhook Handling Best Practices** — Emphasizes short-lived handlers, offloading heavy work to background jobs, and avoiding long-running clone operations.
2. **Node.js Production Checklist** — Highlights the use of connection pooling/keep-alive agents and bounded concurrency for external process execution.
3. **OWASP Logging & Monitoring** — Recommends asynchronous, non-blocking logging to avoid slowing down webhook responses.

## Proposed Improvements

### Immediate Opportunities (0–2 weeks)

| Area | Finding | Recommendation | Impact | Effort |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Clone Strategy | Handlers run `git clone --depth 1` and checkout for every event with no reuse or throttling.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L319-L362】【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L1100-L1162】 | Introduce a bare mirror per repository under `/tmp/cortex-structure-cache/<repo>` and replace `cloneRepository` with `git fetch` + worktree checkout managed by a semaphore (e.g., `p-limit`). | ↓ Median clone latency, ↓ GitHub bandwidth, ↑ throughput | Medium |
| File Enumeration | `getAllFiles` recursively reads the entire repo before scoring push events.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L334-L361】【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L1164-L1188】 | Replace with incremental diff-based analysis using webhook `commits` file lists and fallback to targeted directory sampling. | ↓ CPU + IO during push bursts | Medium |
| Comment Commands | Each @insula command re-clones and recomputes repository context, and progressive reactions issue sequential REST calls.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L368-L520】【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L1334-L1386】 | Cache per-PR analyses in Redis/Local Memory keyed by head SHA and coalesce reaction updates through a batched status comment instead of multiple reactions. | ↓ Comment latency, ↓ Octokit rate pressure | Medium |

### Short-Term Roadmap (2–6 weeks)

1. **Async Work Queue**: Wrap heavy analysis in a job queue (BullMQ/Temporal-lite) triggered by webhook receipt, acknowledging GitHub immediately and processing clones asynchronously to avoid retries.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/server/app.ts†L319-L362】
2. **Context Analyzer Cache**: Persist framework/package metadata in Local Memory keyed by repo + lockfile checksum so repeated commands read from cache before re-hitting disk.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/lib/context-analyzer.ts†L42-L339】
3. **Auto-Fix Batching**: Group sequential fix operations into one `git mv` script and run them using child process pooling to minimize fs thrash.【F:packages/cortex-structure-github/src/core/auto-fix-engine.ts†L37-L120】

### Longer-Term Enhancements (6+ weeks)

- **Incremental Rule Engine**: Extend `StructureValidator` to accept partial file graphs and maintain rolling scores to avoid re-evaluating unaffected directories during large pushes.
- **Observability Budgeting**: Emit trace spans (OTLP) around clone, validation, and Octokit phases to establish p95 baselines aligned with the 250 ms SLA. Instrumentation will confirm improvement from caching initiatives.
- **Horizontal Scaling Strategy**: Evaluate splitting webhook ingestion from analysis microservice with shared queue to better honor concurrency budgets when multiple repositories integrate the app.

### Instrumentation & Validation

- Capture `clone.duration_ms`, `validation.duration_ms`, and `octokit.reaction.calls` metrics through OpenTelemetry exporters to observe improvements after caching.
- Add synthetic workloads that replay push and comment events to compare baseline vs. optimized throughput, targeting a ≥40% reduction in average clone time and ensuring webhook responses stay under 5 seconds.
- Extend `pnpm --filter cortex-structure-github test:smoke` to include regression checks for cached analyses to guard against stale data regressions.
- **TODO:** Replace all estimated baseline metrics in the Benchmarks table with actual measured values once instrumentation is complete.

### Benchmarks

| Scenario | Baseline (Current) | Target |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| Push event processing large repo (10k files) | >60 s end-to-end due to fresh clone + full traversal | <20 s with mirror fetch + diff-based analysis |
| Comment command response | 15–25 s (estimate; to be validated with instrumentation) owing to clone + context analyzer scans | <5 s with cached metadata + batched reactions |
| Auto-fix execution of 20 violations | Sequential 20× fs operations | Batched execution completing in <3 s |
