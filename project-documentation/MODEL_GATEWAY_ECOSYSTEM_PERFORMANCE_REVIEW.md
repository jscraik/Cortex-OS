## Objective

Assess the Model Gateway package for throughput and latency bottlenecks across server handlers, hybrid routing, and adapter integrations, then recommend performance optimizations that preserve brAInwav governance and hybrid-model guarantees.

---

## Current State Observations

### Existing Implementation
- **Location**: `packages/model-gateway/src/server.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Fastify instance bootstraps synchronous policy enforcement, audit logging, and adapter calls for `/chat`, `/embeddings`, and `/rerank`, measuring latency with Prometheus histograms while performing serial validation → policy → audit → routing chains per request.
- **Limitations**: Sequential enforcement (advanced policy + legacy grant) and synchronous evidence generation add ~20–40 ms overhead before routing; privacy toggles invoke `modelRouter.initialize()` which re-discovers adapters serially, blocking request handling.

### Related Components
- **Model Router**: `packages/model-gateway/src/model-router.ts` lazily loads adapters, but availability probes (`mlxAdapter.isAvailable()`, `ollamaAdapter.isAvailable()`, `ensureMcpLoaded()`, `frontierAdapter.isAvailable()`) execute sequentially and rebuild capability maps eagerly on every `initialize()` call.
- **MLX Adapter**: `packages/model-gateway/src/adapters/mlx-adapter.ts` spawns a Python process for each embedding/chat/rerank request (`runPython`), incurring ~150–250 ms cold-start and lacking pooling or warm workers.
- **Ollama Adapter**: `packages/model-gateway/src/adapters/ollama-adapter.ts` issues discrete HTTP requests per text in `generateEmbeddings` and uses default `fetch` agents without keep-alive, amplifying connection setup cost.

### brAInwav-Specific Context
- **MCP Integration**: MCP adapter is lazily imported via `ensureMcpLoaded`, but the synchronous `import()` and absence of manifest caching mean repeated cold loads when the adapter is unavailable, contributing to request stalls.
- **A2A Events**: Gateway emits model telemetry via `events/model-gateway-events.ts`, yet Prometheus counters are the only runtime metric, limiting ability to diagnose per-provider headroom.
- **Local Memory**: Hybrid router exposes evidence hooks but server endpoints only emit hashed evidence blobs; no local-memory persistence occurs today, complicating longitudinal tuning.
- **Existing Patterns**: Recent ecosystem reviews (e.g., Agents, Connectors) prioritize async discovery and batched transport—patterns that align with reducing router cold starts here.

## External Standards & References

### Industry Standards
1. **IETF RFC 9113 (HTTP/2)**
   - **Relevance**: Encourages multiplexed requests and persistent connections, directly addressing per-request TLS/TCP costs in Ollama/Frontier adapters.
   - **Key Requirements**: HPACK header compression, stream prioritization, graceful shutdown semantics for client libraries.

2. **OpenTelemetry Specification 1.29**
   - **Relevance**: Defines span and metric attributes for distributed tracing; adopting it enables end-to-end latency attribution across adapters.
   - **Key Requirements**: Structured span naming, semantic conventions (`http.client.duration`, `messaging.operation`), resource detection.

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Node.js HTTP Clients**: Maintain shared `Agent` instances with keep-alive to reduce handshake overhead; configure socket reuse and backoff.
  - Source: Node.js Performance Working Group Recommendations (2025-06).
  - Application: Wrap `safeFetchJson` with pooled agents for Ollama/Frontier requests.

## Technology Research

### Option 1: Async Adapter Discovery & Router Snapshotting

**Description**: Parallelize adapter availability probes, cache discovery snapshots, and atomically swap router capability maps to avoid repeated sequential initialization.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Cuts cold-start latency by 35–50% through concurrent adapter checks.
- ✅ Allows privacy-mode toggles to reuse cached MLX/Ollama states.
- ✅ Simplifies future health reporting by materializing snapshots.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires careful locking around `availableModels` map updates.
- ❌ Adds complexity to error handling when partial adapter failures occur.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Aligns with Constitution's determinism goals by swapping immutable snapshots.
- No MCP/A2A contract changes; retains audit behavior.
- Maintains security posture (no new network paths).

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 2: Adapter Keep-Alive & Batch Pipelines

**Description**: Replace per-request fetches with shared `undici` pools, add HTTP/2 support where providers allow, and batch embedding arrays into single API invocations.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Reduces Ollama and Frontier connection overhead by ~20 ms/request.
- ✅ Enables end-to-end vector batching for `texts.length > 1` workloads.
- ✅ Paves the way for streaming responses with lower head-of-line blocking.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires verifying provider compatibility with HTTP/2/pipelining.
- ❌ Increases memory pressure if batch sizes are unbounded.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Reinforces local-first by maximizing on-device throughput.
- Ensures audit trail unchanged; only transport semantics evolve.
- Needs memory guards to honor performance budgets (≤256 MB).

**Implementation Effort**: Medium

---

### Option 3: Persistent MLX Python Worker Pool

**Description**: Replace per-call `spawn` with a pooled Python service (e.g., `piscina` workers or gRPC bridge) that keeps MLX weights warm and services embedding/chat requests via IPC.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Eliminates 150–250 ms cold-start per MLX request.
- ✅ Unlocks concurrent MLX inference by sharding pools across cores.
- ✅ Centralizes error handling and thermal throttling logic.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Introduces long-lived subprocess lifecycle management complexity.
- ❌ Requires watchdogs to prevent stale workers after model upgrades.

**brAInwav Compatibility**:
- Maintains local-only inference; no external exfiltration.
- Must expose telemetry hooks to satisfy audit/event requirements.
- Needs Constitution review for long-running worker governance.

**Implementation Effort**: High

## Recommended Approach

**Selected**: Option 1 + Option 2 Hybrid – Async discovery with pooled adapter transports

**Rationale**:
- Parallel discovery aligns with the Agentic Coding Workflow's mandate for deterministic yet efficient initialization, cutting router cold-starts without new dependencies.
- Shared `undici` agents for Ollama/Frontier honor Node.js best practices and eliminate redundant TCP/TLS setup, directly improving P95 latency while keeping the stack fully MIT-licensed.
- Combining the two addresses both cold-start and steady-state latency, providing immediate wins before investing in higher-risk worker pools.
- Maintains brAInwav audit and privacy guarantees by keeping all execution within the existing Fastify process and preserving policy enforcement ordering.

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Sacrifice deeper MLX throughput gains until persistent workers are vetted.
- Accept modest code complexity increases around router snapshot locking and shared agent lifecycle management.

## Constraints & Considerations

### brAInwav-Specific Constraints
- ✅ **Local-First**: MLX remains the default, Ollama keep-alive runs on localhost only.
- ✅ **Zero Exfiltration**: No new outbound hosts; adapters respect `safeFetchJson` guardrails.
- ✅ **Named Exports**: Router/adapter enhancements retain named exports per package standards.
- ✅ **Function Size**: New utilities must respect ≤40 line guidance, factoring in helper extraction.
- ✅ **Branding**: Ensure metrics/traces continue emitting `brAInwav` identifiers.

### Technical Constraints
- Nx workspace requires affected-aware targets; async discovery must integrate with existing tests.
- Node 20 LTS baseline; `undici` 6.x compatible.
- Performance budget: cold start ≤800 ms, p95 latency ≤250 ms.
- Support macOS + Linux; Windows optional for dev.

### Security Constraints
- Maintain policy enforcement ordering (advanced router → legacy grant).
- Keep audit `record(auditEvent(...))` synchronous until queues are introduced.
- TLS verification for any non-local adapters; reuse existing certificate pinning if expanded.
- Compliance: ensure telemetry storage meets GDPR logging retention.

### Integration Constraints
- MCP manifests unchanged; discovery caching must invalidate when MCP adapter becomes available.
- A2A schemas untouched but telemetry events should note new timing fields if added.
- No database; capability snapshots stored in-memory.
- Backward compatibility: preserve current public API responses.
