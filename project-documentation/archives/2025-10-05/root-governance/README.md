# brAInwav Root Governance Archive â€” 2025-10-05

The files in this directory were relocated from the Cortex-OS repository root on 2025-10-05 to satisfy Structure Guard
policies. They include deployment guides, hand-off reports, and commit message templates generated during prior
engagement phases.

Continue to store retrospective governance collateral beneath `project-documentation/archives/` so the repository root
remains limited to approved brAInwav artifacts.
