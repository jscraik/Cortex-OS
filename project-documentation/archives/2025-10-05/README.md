# brAInwav Root Artifact Archive â€” 2025-10-05

This directory houses historical documents and generated reports that previously lived at the repository root.
All files were relocated on 2025-10-05 to satisfy Structure Guard governance for the Cortex-OS monorepo while
preserving full auditability for brAInwav engineering reviews.

- `root-governance/` contains legacy governance docs, commit message templates, and session summaries.
- `doc-maintenance/` stores outputs from the October 2025 documentation sweep, including manifests and reports.

Please keep future archival material within this hierarchy or request an update to the Structure Guard policy
before introducing new root-level artifacts.
