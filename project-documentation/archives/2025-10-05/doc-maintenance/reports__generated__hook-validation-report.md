# Git Hooks Validation Report

## Hook Configuration Status âœ…

### Husky Setup

- **Git hooks path**: `.husky/_` âœ…
- **Configuration**: Properly set via `git config core.hooksPath .husky/_`
- **Hook files**: Present and executable in `.husky/_/` directory
- **Delegation**: Hooks properly delegate to main scripts in `.husky/`

### Pre-commit Hook Status âœ…

- **Location**: `.husky/pre-commit` (6,673 bytes)
- **Executable**: Yes âœ…
- **Features**:
  - Staged file validation
  - Compiled file detection in source directories
  - lint-staged pipeline integration
  - Affected test execution with timeouts
  - Python linting (ruff) support
  - Quick memory regression checks
  - Performance monitoring

### Pre-push Hook Status âœ…

- **Location**: `.husky/pre-push` (6,498 bytes)  
- **Executable**: Yes âœ…
- **Features**:
  - Full tree linting
  - Security scanning (semgrep)
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Python validation (ruff + pyright)
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Structure validation

## Fixed Issues

### 1. NX Configuration Error âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: `NX The {workspaceRoot} token is only valid at the beginning of an option. (packages/rag:[object Object])`

**Root Cause**: Incorrect usage of `{workspaceRoot}` token in `cwd` field in `packages/rag/project.json`

**Fix Applied**:

- Moved `{workspaceRoot}` references from `cwd` option to command paths
- Updated three targets: `test`, `bench`, and `bench:pq`
- This resolves the NX configuration parsing error

### 2. Hook Execution Environment âœ… VERIFIED

**Environment Setup**:

- PNPM path configuration via `common.sh`
- Node version management (nvm/fnm) support
- Corepack fallback for pnpm installation
- PATH environment properly configured

## Test Results

### Pre-commit Hook Test âœ… PASSED

- Successfully executed lint-staged pipeline
- Biome formatting applied correctly
- Performance metrics captured
- No false positives

### Environment Variables Support âœ…

- `CORTEX_SKIP_HOOK_TESTS=1` - Skip test execution
- `CORTEX_SKIP_PREPUSH=1` - Emergency bypass for pre-push
- `CORTEX_SKIP_MEMORY_PRECOMMIT=1` - Skip memory checks
- `CORTEX_MEMORY_BLOCK=1` - Make memory checks blocking

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Hook execution times are tracked and reported
2. **Memory Management**: Quick memory regression checks in pre-commit (non-blocking by default)
3. **Security Integration**: Pre-push includes semgrep security scanning
4. **Emergency Bypasses**: Environment variables available for urgent situations

## Status Summary

ðŸŸ¢ **All hooks are operational and properly configured**
ðŸŸ¢ **NX configuration issues resolved**
ðŸŸ¢ **Environment setup verified**
ðŸŸ¢ **Performance monitoring active**

The git hooks are now fully functional and should prevent issues during development workflow.
