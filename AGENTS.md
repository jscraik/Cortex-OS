# AGENTS

These instructions apply to all developers and AI agents working in this repository.

## Workflow

- Practice strict Test-Driven Development (TDD).
  - Start with a failing test that defines each requirement.
  - Implement the minimal code to make the test pass.
  - Refactor while keeping tests green.
- Break work into micro-tasks.
  - Limit each commit to a single focused change.
  - Include tests and implementation in the same commit.

## Commit Policy

- Use Conventional Commits with clear scopes (e.g., `feat(auth): add login validation`).
- Reference related issue or task identifiers when available.
- Keep history linear; avoid amend or force-push operations.

## Validation

Run the following checks before submitting a commit (Husky hooks run automatically on commit):

```bash
# Quick local checks
pnpm biome:staged   # format + lint staged files
pnpm lint
pnpm test
# For documentation-only changes
pnpm docs:lint

# Emergency bypass (use sparingly)
# HUSKY=0 git commit -m "..."
```

## Persistent Agent Memory (Local Memory)

Enable persistent context across runs using Local Memory.

Setup:

- Start the Local Memory daemon (default base URL `http://localhost:3002/api/v1`).
- Export envs:
  - `LOCAL_MEMORY_BASE_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:3010/api/v1`)
  - `LOCAL_MEMORY_API_KEY` (if configured)
  - `LOCAL_MEMORY_NAMESPACE` (optional)
  - `MEMORIES_ADAPTER` or `MEMORY_STORE` = `local | sqlite | prisma | memory`

Quick verify:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3002/api/v1/health | jq .
```

Code path:

- Use `createStoreFromEnv()` from `@cortex-os/memories` to auto-select Local Memory when `LOCAL_MEMORY_BASE_URL` is present.
- Falls back to SQLite or in-memory based on envs.

Privacy note: follow `.cortex/rules/RULES_OF_AI.md` — avoid storing secrets or personal data without consent; prefer encryption where applicable.

## 🔧 Agent Toolkit (MANDATORY)

The `packages/agent-toolkit` provides a **unified, contract-driven interface** for all development  
operations. This toolkit is **REQUIRED** for maintaining monorepo uniformity and code quality.

### Core Integration Pattern

```typescript
import { createAgentToolkit } from '@cortex-os/agent-toolkit';

const toolkit = createAgentToolkit();
// Use TypeScript interface for programmatic access
await toolkit.multiSearch('pattern', './src');
await toolkit.validateProject(['*.ts', '*.py', '*.rs']);
```

### Shell Interface (Just Recipes)

- `just scout "pattern" path` - Multi-tool search (ripgrep + semgrep + ast-grep)
- `just codemod 'find(:[x])' 'replace(:[x])' path` - Structural modifications
- `just verify changed.txt` - Auto-validation based on file types

### When Agents MUST Use Agent-Toolkit

1. **Code Search Operations** - Instead of raw grep/rg commands
2. **Structural Modifications** - For any refactoring or codemod operations  
3. **Quality Validation** - Before commits, PRs, or code changes
4. **Cross-Language Tasks** - Unified interface for TypeScript/Python/Rust
5. **Pre-Commit Workflows** - Automated validation pipelines

### Architecture Compliance

Agent-toolkit follows Cortex-OS principles:

- **Contract-first**: Zod schemas ensure type safety
- **Event-driven**: A2A integration ready
- **MCP compatible**: Tool exposure for agent consumption
- **Layered design**: Clean domain/app/infra separation

**Legacy Note**: Agents should leverage scripts in `agent-toolkit/tools` for code search, structural  
rewrites, diff review and validation. Use `just` recipes (`just scout`, `just codemod`, `just verify`)  
or call the wrappers directly. Run standard checks (`pnpm biome:staged`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`,  
`pnpm docs:lint`) alongside these tools.

## 🚀 Smart Nx Execution (Affected-Only)

All agents MUST prefer the smart wrapper for build/test/lint/typecheck operations:

```bash
pnpm build:smart       # node scripts/nx-smart.mjs build
pnpm test:smart        # node scripts/nx-smart.mjs test
pnpm lint:smart        # node scripts/nx-smart.mjs lint
pnpm typecheck:smart   # node scripts/nx-smart.mjs typecheck

# Dry-run mode (preview affected projects without execution)
node scripts/nx-smart.mjs build --dry-run
```

Behavior:

- Auto-detects `base`/`head` via environment (`NX_BASE`, `NX_HEAD`) or falls back to the previous commit.
- Runs `nx print-affected` first (fast fail + transparency) then executes `nx affected -t <target>`.
- Falls back to full `run-many` only if diff detection fails (rare – logs a warning banner).
- Emits a concise strategy line: `strategy=affected|all changed=<count>` for observability.
- Supports `--dry-run` to preview affected projects without execution (useful for PR preflight).

Rationale: Prevents wasteful monorepo-wide execution and reduces memory churn + CI wall time.

### Focused Runs (Selective Affected Subset)

When you only care about a narrow slice of the affected graph (e.g., iterating on a
single package), you can constrain execution with a focus filter:

```bash
# Limit to a couple of projects (intersection with affected set)
node scripts/nx-smart.mjs test --focus @cortex-os/agent-toolkit,@cortex-os/telemetry

# Environment variable form (preferred for CI matrix or aliases)
CORTEX_SMART_FOCUS=@cortex-os/agent-toolkit pnpm test:smart

# Combine with dry-run to preview the trimmed set
node scripts/nx-smart.mjs lint --focus @cortex-os/agent-toolkit --dry-run
```

Behavior:

- The full affected list is computed first; focus then reduces it to the intersection.
- If no overlap exists, the original affected list is used (a notice is logged).
- Works with all targets (`build|test|lint|typecheck`) and supports `--json` + `--dry-run` modes.
- Use sparingly in CI to avoid hiding transitive breakages; ideal for fast local iteration.

Anti-patterns:

- Forcing focus in shared CI without a separate full coverage job.
- Using focus to bypass required dependent builds (e.g., skipping contracts when modifying a consumer).

Tip: Pair with `--dry-run` before committing to ensure you are not masking an expected dependency.

## 🤖 Non-Interactive Nx Mode

The wrapper enforces non-interactive execution by default:

- Sets `NX_INTERACTIVE=false` (and `CI=true` if unset) for deterministic, prompt-free runs.
- Passes `--no-interactive` ONLY to the top-level Nx CLI (not forwarded to underlying toolchains like `tsc`, `vitest`, or `tsup`).
- Override (rare) by exporting `CORTEX_NX_INTERACTIVE=1` before invoking a smart script.

Example override:

```bash
CORTEX_NX_INTERACTIVE=1 pnpm build:smart
```

Policy: Do **not** override in automation / CI pipelines. Interactive mode is only for local
diagnostic exploration when inspecting task graph decisions.

## 📊 Wrapper Diagnostics

Each invocation prints a header line:

```text
[nx-smart] target=test base=<sha> head=<sha> changed=<n> strategy=affected
```

Dry-run mode shows affected summary:

```text
📋 Affected Projects Summary:
Target: build
Base: origin/main  
Head: abc123
Changed files: 15
Affected projects: @cortex-os/agents, @cortex-os/mcp-core

💡 To execute: pnpm build:smart
```

If diff resolution fails, you will see:

```text
[nx-smart][warn] unable to resolve git diff – falling back to full run-many
```

Action for agents: investigate git environment (shallow clone? detached HEAD?) before re-running.

## 🧪 When Writing New Automation

- Use smart scripts inside composite commands (e.g., release gates) instead of raw `nx run-many`.
- Avoid chaining `pnpm build && pnpm test`; prefer targeted: `pnpm build:smart && pnpm test:smart`.
- For security / structure validations, run AFTER `build:smart` to leverage any generated artifacts.

## 🧹 Pending Deprecations

Legacy scripts using blanket `nx run-many` will be pruned; keep memory management scripts (`memory:*`)
intact. Prefer adding any new orchestration logic to the smart wrapper or agent-toolkit utilities.
