## Scope & Goals

### In Scope
- ✅ LangGraph.js state graph orchestration (slice → plan → execute → pack)
- ✅ Hybrid model router with MLX-first policy and cloud burst
- ✅ Context graph APIs with evidence gating and ABAC compliance
- ✅ Thermal-aware orchestration preventing system overload
- ✅ Privacy mode enforcement for governed runs
- ✅ A2A event integration with comprehensive audit trails
- ✅ Quality gates with automated validation
- ✅ Performance monitoring and SLA compliance
- ✅ brAInwav branding in all outputs and error messages

### Out of Scope
- ❌ New UI components (focus on backend integration)
- ❌ Database schema changes (uses existing GraphRAG infrastructure)
- ❌ External service dependencies beyond existing MLX/Ollama/cloud
- ❌ Major architectural changes to existing Cortex-OS patterns

### Success Criteria
1. All tests pass (100% green) with 90%+ coverage
2. Quality gates pass: `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm security:scan`
3. LangGraph.js integration works with existing thermal management
4. Hybrid router follows MLX-first policy with cloud burst for >20k tokens
5. Evidence gating prevents policy violations
6. Performance targets met: <100ms context ops, <50ms routing
7. A2A events flow correctly with audit trails
8. Privacy mode enforces local-only operation
9. No mock/placeholder code in production paths
10. brAInwav branding consistently applied

## Architecture Decisions

### Key Design Choices

1. **LangGraph.js State Graph**: Extends existing `CerebrumAnnotation` patterns
   - **Rationale**: Leverages existing thermal management and budget controls
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Custom state machine, separate orchestration service
   - **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex but better integration

2. **Hybrid Model Router**: Evidence-first filtering before routing decisions
   - **Rationale**: Ensures governance compliance before any model access
   - **Impact**: Prevents policy violations regardless of model choice

3. **Context Graph Slicing**: Topology-bounded extraction with GraphRAG
   - **Rationale**: Provides coherent context with proper citation
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Simple vector search, keyword-based extraction

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Thermal overload during context operations | Thermal-aware orchestration with automatic throttling | Planned |
| PII leakage through context graphs | Evidence gating and ABAC filtering before routing | Planned |
| Cloud model dependency | MLX-first policy with local fallback | Planned |
| Performance degradation | Sub-100ms targets with caching and optimization | Planned |
| Integration complexity | Phased implementation with comprehensive testing | Planned |

---

## Performance Considerations

### Expected Performance
- **Context slicing**: <100ms for typical requests
- **Model routing**: <50ms decision time
- **Thermal response**: <200ms for policy enforcement
- **Memory usage**: Efficient garbage collection for context objects

### Optimization Opportunities
- Context caching for repeated queries
- Model pre-warming for faster response
- Connection pooling for cloud models
- Lazy loading for large context graphs

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **Context operation latency**: Track slicing and packing performance
- **Model routing decisions**: Monitor local vs cloud selection
- **Thermal policy enforcement**: Track throttling events
- **Evidence gate effectiveness**: Monitor policy compliance

### Alerts to Configure
- **Context operation latency >200ms**: Warning
- **Model routing failures**: Critical
- **Thermal throttling events**: Warning
- **Evidence gate violations**: Critical

### Dashboards
- Context Graph performance dashboard
- Model routing analytics
- Thermal management overview
- Evidence gate compliance monitoring
