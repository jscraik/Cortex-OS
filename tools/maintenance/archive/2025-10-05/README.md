# brAInwav Maintenance Script Archive â€” 2025-10-05

This directory stores one-off TypeScript scripts that were previously left at the repository root to patch analytics
modules. They have been archived here to keep the Cortex-OS workspace aligned with Structure Guard requirements while
maintaining a traceable history for brAInwav reliability audits.

Scripts in this folder operate on historical paths and may no longer reflect the current package layout. Consult the
latest observability or analytics documentation before reusing them.
