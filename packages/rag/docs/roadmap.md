## REF窶然AG Implementation Details

### Version 1.0 (Completed 笨)

**Core Architecture:**
- **Tri-Band Context System**: Band A (full text), Band B (virtual tokens), Band C (structured facts)
- **Risk Classification**: Automated query risk assessment with mandatory expansion hints
- **Fact Extraction**: Lightweight regex-based extraction for numbers, quotes, code, dates, entities
- **Compression Encoding**: Virtual token generation with configurable compression ratios
- **Relevance Policy**: Hybrid scoring combining similarity, freshness, diversity, domain relevance
- **Budget Management**: Risk-class specific allocations with conservative/default/aggressive presets
- **Verification Engine**: Self-check and escalation orchestration for critical queries
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: End-to-end REF窶然AG processing with traceability

**Integration Points:**
- **Model Gateway**: Enhanced chat schema with tri-band context support
- **MLX Python Runner**: Native Apple Silicon acceleration for virtual token processing
- **Generation Pipeline**: `generateWithBands` method for tri-band context handling
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for all REF窶然AG components

**Performance Targets:**
- LOW Risk: 120ms latency, 50 req/s throughput, 92% accuracy
- MEDIUM Risk: 250ms latency, 30 req/s throughput, 95% accuracy
- HIGH Risk: 450ms latency, 20 req/s throughput, 97% accuracy
- CRITICAL: 800ms latency, 10 req/s throughput, 99% accuracy

### Version 1.1 (Planned 泅ｧ)

**Advanced Features:**
- Enhanced compression algorithms with adaptive ratios
- Multi-modal context support (images, audio, video)
- Distributed processing across multiple nodes
- Advanced verification system with external fact-checking integration

### Version 2.0 (Future 沒)

**Next Generation:**
- Federated retrieval across multiple knowledge bases
- Real-time context updates and cache invalidation
- Advanced reasoning chains with logical inference
- Cross-lingual support with translation capabilities

Enterprise quickstarts will cover overlay deployments and multi-tenant setups as these features become available.
