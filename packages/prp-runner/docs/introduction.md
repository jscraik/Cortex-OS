# Introduction

`@cortex-os/prp-runner` orchestrates prompt-response processing workflows. It coordinates "sub-agents"—small computational units—to execute complex AI tasks. The runner handles execution context, enforcement hooks, and result aggregation.

PRP Runner solves the challenge of managing heterogeneous AI tools by providing a uniform interface and predictable execution model.
