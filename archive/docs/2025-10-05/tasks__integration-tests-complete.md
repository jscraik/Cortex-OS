### Reflection Workflow Tests (1/1)
- ✅ Quality improvement loop (output → critique → feedback → improve)

### Complete Agent Workflow Tests (2/2)
- ✅ Plan → Execute → Reflect workflow
- ✅ ToT → Execute best → Reflect → Try alternative

### Multimodal Integration Tests (2/2)

- ✅ Reflection storage in multimodal memory

### Operational Integration Tests (2/2)

## Integration Scenarios Tested

### Scenario 1: Complete CoT Workflow

```python
# 1. Generate plan (Phase 4.1)
planner = CoTPlanner()
plan = planner.generate_plan(goal="Implement auth", context={})

# 2. Validate plan (Phase 4.1)
validation = validate_plan(plan)
assert validation["valid"] is True

# 3. Store in memory (Phase 3)
memory = planner.plan_to_memory(plan)
assert memory["modality"] == "TEXT"

# 4. Reconstruct from memory
reconstructed = planner.memory_to_plan(memory)
assert reconstructed["id"] == plan["id"]
```

### Scenario 2: ToT with Multi-Branch Selection

```python
# 1. Generate branches (Phase 4.3)
tot_planner = ToTPlanner()
plan = tot_planner.generate_plan(goal="Design auth", context={})

# 2. Verify scoring
assert all(0 <= b["score"] <= 10 for b in plan["branches"])

# 3. Verify best selection
best = next(b for b in plan["branches"] if b["id"] == plan["best_branch_id"])
assert best["score"] == max(b["score"] for b in plan["branches"])
```

### Scenario 3: Iterative Improvement Loop

```python
# 1. Low-quality output
output = {"content": "Basic", "confidence": 0.4}

# 2. Critique (Phase 4.2)
reflector = SelfReflector()
critique = reflector.critique_output(output)
assert critique["approved"] is False

# 3. Generate feedback
feedback = reflector.generate_feedback(output)
assert len(feedback["action_items"]) > 0

# 4. Apply improvement
improved = reflector.improve_output(output, feedback)
assert improved["confidence"] > output["confidence"]
```

### Scenario 4: Plan → Execute → Reflect

```python
# 1. Plan with CoT
plan = cot_planner.generate_plan(goal="Add feature", context={})

# 2. Execute (mock)
output = {
    "content": "Implemented JWT authentication",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Industry best practices"
}

# 3. Reflect on execution
critique = reflector.critique_output(output)
assert critique["approved"] is True

# 4. Store both plan and reflection
plan_memory = cot_planner.plan_to_memory(plan)
reflection_memory = reflector.reflection_to_memory(critique, output)

assert "planning" in plan_memory["tags"]
assert "reflection" in reflection_memory["tags"]
```

### Scenario 5: ToT → Fallback Strategy

```python
# 1. Generate multi-branch plan
plan = tot_planner.generate_plan(goal="Optimize performance", context={})

# 2. Execute best branch
best_branch = next(b for b in plan["branches"] if b["id"] == plan["best_branch_id"])
output = execute(best_branch)  # Mock execution

# 3. Reflect on quality
critique = reflector.critique_output(output)

# 4. If low quality, try alternative
if critique["quality_score"] < 0.7:
    sorted_branches = sorted(plan["branches"], key=lambda b: b["score"], reverse=True)
    alternative = sorted_branches[1]  # Second-best
    output = execute(alternative)
```

### Scenario 6: Health Monitoring During Operations

```python
# 1. Check health (Phase 5.1)
health_service = HealthService()
health = health_service.check_health()
assert health["status"] in ["healthy", "degraded", "unhealthy"]

# 2. Perform planning operation (Phase 4)
plan = planner.generate_plan(goal="Test", context={})

# 3. Health still operational
health_after = health_service.check_health()
assert health_after is not None
```

### Scenario 7: Graceful Shutdown Cleanup

```python
# 1. Setup shutdown manager (Phase 5.2)
shutdown = GracefulShutdown()

# 2. Register planning cleanup
async def cleanup_planning():
    # Close planning resources
    pass

shutdown.register_cleanup(cleanup_planning)

# 3. Execute shutdown
await shutdown.shutdown()

assert shutdown.is_shutting_down() is True
```
