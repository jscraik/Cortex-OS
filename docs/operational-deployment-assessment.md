# Cortex-OS Operational Deployment Assessment

## Objective & Methodology
- **Objective**: Quantify Cortex-OS deployment maturity across governance, platform, services, and operations with a normalized score out of 100%.
- **Inputs Reviewed**: Architecture primers, deployment guides, package-level implementations, readiness tooling, security documentation, quality metrics, and operational runbooks.
- **Method**: Applied an eight-dimension rubric covering architecture, infrastructure, security, data services, observability, CI/CD quality, documentation, and incident response. Each dimension is graded on a 0–100 scale; weighted totals produce the overall deployment score.

## Scoring Overview
| Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted Contribution |
|-----------|-------:|------:|----------------------:|
| Architecture & Governance | 15 | 85 | 12.8 |
| Platform & Infrastructure | 15 | 80 | 12.0 |
| Security & Compliance | 15 | 78 | 11.7 |
| Application & Data Services | 12 | 82 | 9.8 |
| Observability & Performance | 10 | 75 | 7.5 |
| CI/CD & Quality Automation | 13 | 70 | 9.1 |
| Documentation & Knowledge | 10 | 88 | 8.8 |
| Operations & Incident Response | 10 | 72 | 7.2 |
| **Total** | **100** | — | **78.9** |

**Deployment Verdict**: **78.9/100** — Cortex-OS is architecturally ready with strong documentation and mature service foundations, but inconsistent enforcement artifacts (readiness thresholds, CI evidence, telemetry adoption) prevent a higher confidence score.

## Dimension Findings

### Architecture & Governance — 85/100 (Weight 15)
- Governance principles (contract-first design, event-driven A2A bus, strict import boundaries) are clearly codified and visually reinforced, supporting consistent deployment architecture decisions.【F:docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md†L8-L86】
- Root README reiterates production-grade expectations (coverage, security scanning, smart Nx execution), aligning contributors on operational guardrails.【F:README.md†L40-L170】
- Gap: enforcement evidence (recent CI runs, waiver ledger) is not bundled with documentation, limiting verifiable governance adherence during audits.

### Platform & Infrastructure — 80/100 (Weight 15)
- Production deployment guide covers Docker and Kubernetes rollouts with concrete secrets management, health checks, and scaling prerequisites, demonstrating comprehensive platform readiness.【F:docs/deployment-guide.md†L1-L115】【F:docs/deployment-guide.md†L116-L210】
- Smart Nx wrapper enforces non-interactive CI defaults while optionally emitting OpenTelemetry metrics, enabling efficient platform automation across environments.【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L1-L120】【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L16-L68】
- Gap: guide references external tooling but omits validated infrastructure-as-code examples or live cluster manifests beyond overlays, so reproducibility evidence is partial.

### Security & Compliance — 78/100 (Weight 15)
- Security package delivers SPIFFE/SPIRE, mTLS orchestration, Semgrep profiles, and ASVS alignment with clear command coverage, showcasing deep defense-in-depth controls.【F:packages/security/README.md†L1-L146】
- Workspace scripts include comprehensive semgrep/Snyk pipelines and strict security gates for CI execution, evidencing actionable enforcement hooks.【F:package.json†L138-L170】
- Gap: readiness manifest for the security package sets coverage thresholds to zero, contradicting claimed enforcement and reducing trust in automated compliance gating.【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】

### Application & Data Services — 82/100 (Weight 12)
- Memory-core refactor documentation details unified memory orchestration, hybrid local/remote search, and containerized deployment architecture, signaling production-capable service design.【F:packages/memory-core/README.md†L1-L156】
- Architecture overview highlights clear layering (apps, packages, shared libs, control plane) and communication contracts, enabling predictable service deployment topologies.【F:docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md†L17-L56】
- Gap: while plans are exhaustive, audit trails confirming completion of the multi-phase TDD plan and Docker Compose assets are not surfaced in this review.

### Observability & Performance — 75/100 (Weight 10)
- Observability utilities provide configurable OTLP/Jaeger exporters and flamegraph tooling, offering a solid basis for telemetry integration.【F:packages/observability/README.md†L1-L16】
- Performance monitoring runbook documents automated process health checks, memory governance, and MCP pooling, reflecting mature operational instrumentation patterns.【F:docs/performance-monitoring.md†L1-L188】
- Gap: adoption evidence (which services enable OTEL spans by default) is absent, and performance metrics are largely anecdotal without attached dashboards or CI artifacts.

### CI/CD & Quality Automation — 70/100 (Weight 13)
- Package scripts orchestrate extensive readiness, coverage, mutation, CBOM, and focused Nx pipelines, demonstrating broad automation coverage.【F:package.json†L11-L206】
- Quality metrics reference explicit thresholds (90% coverage, 75% mutation) and badge generation workflows, signaling intent to enforce continuous quality gates.【F:docs/quality-metrics.md†L1-L104】
- Gap: current readiness manifests allow zero coverage thresholds (e.g., security package), undermining CI gate reliability; mutation and coverage reports cited in docs are not embedded for verification.【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】

### Documentation & Knowledge — 88/100 (Weight 10)
- Documentation suite spans quick starts, deployment, architecture, memory, observability, and governance, giving operators rich onboarding material.【F:README.md†L40-L170】【F:docs/deployment-guide.md†L1-L210】
- Knowledge artifacts include detailed quality metrics and memory architecture plans, enabling cross-team alignment on operational practices.【F:docs/quality-metrics.md†L1-L104】【F:packages/memory-core/README.md†L1-L156】
- Gap: Some documents cite badges and thresholds without attached live evidence, preventing 100% confidence scores.

### Operations & Incident Response — 72/100 (Weight 10)
- Session and process management tooling automates health checks, restarts, cache cleanup, and MCP pooling, reducing mean time to recovery during incidents.【F:docs/performance-monitoring.md†L7-L188】
- Root scripts expose numerous ops commands (ops CLI, session manager, performance monitor), providing actionable runbook coverage for responders.【F:package.json†L150-L158】【F:package.json†L81-L85】
- Gap: Formal incident response playbooks and paging/escalation procedures are not documented within reach, and telemetry adoption gaps reduce detectability confidence.

## Priority Recommendations
1. **Reinstate Readiness Thresholds** — Regenerate or update `readiness.yml` files to enforce ≥95% coverage defaults and publish latest summaries alongside the security and critical packages.【F:tools/readiness/check-readiness.mjs†L1-L74】【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】
2. **Attach CI Evidence** — Embed recent coverage, mutation, and security scan artifacts referenced by badges into the repo or documentation to substantiate enforcement claims.【F:docs/quality-metrics.md†L1-L63】【F:README.md†L9-L82】
3. **Instrument Adoption Audit** — Document which services enable OpenTelemetry exporters and smart Nx telemetry in production to close observability verification gaps.【F:packages/observability/README.md†L1-L16】【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L16-L68】
4. **Publish Incident Playbooks** — Extend existing process-monitoring runbooks with escalation paths, SLO targets, and recovery drills to lift operational confidence.【F:docs/performance-monitoring.md†L21-L188】

## Residual Risks
- Deployment confidence depends on external CI artifacts (badges, scan logs) that were not available in-repo during this review, leaving evidence gaps for auditors.【F:README.md†L9-L82】
- Without enforced readiness thresholds, regressions in coverage or security posture could pass undetected despite tooling breadth.【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】【F:tools/readiness/check-readiness.mjs†L33-L71】
- Observability tooling exists but lacks documented adoption metrics, risking blind spots during production incidents.【F:packages/observability/README.md†L1-L16】【F:docs/performance-monitoring.md†L21-L188】
