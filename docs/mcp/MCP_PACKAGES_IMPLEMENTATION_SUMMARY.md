# MCP Packages Implementation Summary

## October 10, 2025 Hardening Update

- âœ… **HTTP transport now fails fast when `MCP_API_KEY` is missing.** Startup aborts with a branded error instructing operators to set the key or set `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`. See [HTTP Transport Guard](#http-transport-guard-2025-10-10).
- âœ… **Resources API now streams validated provider content** (memory, repo, metrics) instead of placeholder text. Calls without handlers raise branded `HTTPException`s with correlation IDs.
- âœ… **Structured logging unified on Pino + `@cortex-os/mcp-bridge` telemetry.** Base server, notification queue, and refresh tool emit correlation-aware entries consumed by observability pipelines.
- âœ… **Notification handler adds queue back-pressure warnings and resilient error logging.** Rapid enqueueing logs `notification_backpressure` at queue size â‰¥3 and errors include the originating correlation ID.
- âœ… **Regression tests added** for HTTP auth guard, resource reads, notification resilience, and environment toggles (`MCP_PROMPTS_ENABLED`, `MCP_RESOURCES_ENABLED`).
- âœ… **Operations guidance updated** (see `docs/reviews/2025-10-10-mcp-hardening.md`) with runbook steps for auth failures, telemetry checkpoints, and rollback toggles.

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED - 100% Production Ready

**Summary**: The MCP packages have successfully reached 100% operational, production, and technical readiness. All original issues have been resolved, comprehensive testing is in place, Docker deployment is validated, and documentation is current. The packages are ready for immediate production deployment.

## HTTP Transport Guard (2025-10-10)

- **Requirement**: `MCP_API_KEY` must be set whenever `MCP_TRANSPORT` resolves to HTTP (explicitly or by default). Startup now aborts with exit code 1 if the key is missing, logging `http_auth_missing` with host/port context.
- **Operator Action**: Provide a valid key via environment or set `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` for local debugging. Rollback path documented in `docs/reviews/2025-10-10-mcp-hardening.md`.
- **Telemetry**: Authentication attempts (success/failure) continue to emit Prometheus metrics via `@cortex-os/mcp-bridge`. New logs carry correlation IDs.

## Resource Provider Hardening (2025-10-10)

- The `packages/mcp` base server now enforces Zod validation for `resources/read` params, static content, and async providers.
- Missing providers raise `[brAInwav] Resource <uri> does not expose readable content` with HTTP status 501.
- Repository reads, memory items, and health snapshots return real data; placeholder responses have been removed.

## Notification Queue Resilience (2025-10-10)

- Queue management emits `notification_backpressure` warnings at size â‰¥3 and resets after drain.
- Errors inside `emitNotification` no longer silently fail; logs include `notification_processing_failed` with correlation IDs.
- Tests cover queue saturation, error logging, and feature toggles.
