# Skills System Integration - Research

**Feature Name**: skills-system-integration
**Research Phase**: Phase 1
**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Researcher**: Claude Code Agent

## Executive Summary

This research document analyzes the feasibility of integrating a skills system into Cortex-OS, an ASBR (Autonomous Software Behavior Reasoning) Runtime. The skills system will enable agents to discover, load, and apply test-driven reference guides with persuasive framing to improve compliance under pressure scenarios.

## RAID Analysis

### Risks

**High Priority Risks:**
1. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Malicious skill content could compromise agent behavior
   - *Impact*: High - could lead to unauthorized agent actions
   - *Probability*: Medium - requires skill content injection

2. **Performance Degradation** - Skill indexing and search may impact system performance
   - *Impact*: Medium - could affect real-time agent operations
   - *Probability*: High - vector operations are computationally expensive
   - *Mitigation*: Lazy loading, caching, efficient vector search

3. **Architectural Coupling** - New dependencies could violate Cortex-OS boundaries
