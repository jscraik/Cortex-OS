# Security Operations Plan Evidence Bucket

This folder captures security scan artifacts, incident response notes, and disclosure evidence referenced by `.github/workflows/security-consolidated.yml` and the security operations plan. Upload CI outputs (pnpm security:scan, Semgrep, gitleaks, OSV, SBOM) here when preparing release readiness or responding to vulnerabilities.
