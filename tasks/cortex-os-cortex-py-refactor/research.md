## Executive Summary

This research phase analyzed the existing Cortex-OS and Cortex-Py codebase to identify refactoring opportunities aligned with brAInwav standards, code-change-planner format, and AGENTS.md governance requirements.

**Key Finding**: The existing TDD plan required restructuring to match the code-change-planner format while preserving the operational MCP server architecture.
