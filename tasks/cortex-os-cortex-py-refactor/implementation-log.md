- Appendix D: Acceptance Test Matrix
- Appendix E: Task Folder Structure

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Original plan had mixed chronological/topical organization
- File tree needed comprehensive mapping to repository structure
- MCP preservation requirement needed explicit documentation throughout

**Decisions Made**:
- Use code-change-planner format exactly as specified
- Preserve all existing phase completion statuses
- Add comprehensive appendices for usability
- Document all 45 file changes with annotations

**Evidence**:
- Created: `tdd-plan.md` (2,593 lines, +33% from original)
- Statistics: 11 sections, 97 subsections, 5 appendices
- All paths verified against repository layout

**Deviations from Plan**: None - followed code-change-planner format strictly

**Next**: Complete task folder organization and validation

---

## 2025-01-XX - Task Folder Structure Reorganization

**Phase**: 3 - Implementation  
**Action**: Reorganized files to match TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md requirements  
**Outcome**: Full compliance with mandatory folder structure

**Completed**:
- Created: `research.md` (RAID analysis, PIECES, spikes, PoCs)
- Created: `implementation-plan.md` (SRS, architecture, timeline)
- Created: `implementation-checklist.md` (actionable breakdown)
- Created: `implementation-log.md` (this file)
- Moved: `tdd-plan.md` from flat structure to task folder
- Moved: `refactor-summary.md` to refactoring/ subfolder
- Moved: `validation-report.md` to verification/ subfolder

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Files were originally in flat `/tasks` directory
- Non-compliant with TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md governance

**Decisions Made**:
- Create all required files per phase requirements
- Organize supporting documents in appropriate subfolders
- Follow naming conventions exactly

**Evidence**:
- Full folder structure matching TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md
- All required files present for Phases 0-2
- Subfolders created for future artifacts

**Next**: Create validation report and summary documents

---

## 2025-01-XX - Validation and Summary Documents

**Phase**: 3 - Implementation  
**Action**: Created comprehensive validation and summary documents  
**Outcome**: Full documentation package complete

**Completed**:
- Created: `refactoring/refactor-summary.md` (statistics, changes, compliance)
- Created: `verification/validation-report.md` (comprehensive validation)
- Validation included:
  - Format compliance (8/8 sections)
  - AGENTS.md compliance (16/16 requirements)
  - CODESTYLE.md compliance (18/18 standards)
  - Technical accuracy (all paths verified)
  - Evidence quality assessment
  - Risk analysis quality review
  - Testing strategy quality assessment
  - Appendices quality evaluation

**Challenges Encountered**: None - straightforward documentation

**Decisions Made**:
- Provide detailed statistics for transparency
- Validate against all governance requirements
- Include improvement recommendations
- Document success metrics tracking

**Evidence**:
- refactor-summary.md: 9,484 characters
- validation-report.md: 12,784 characters
- All validation criteria passed

**Next**: Update implementation log and prepare for review phase

## Notes & Observations

### What's Working Well

1. **Code-change-planner format** provides excellent structure and clarity
2. **Task folder organization** makes artifacts easy to locate
3. **Comprehensive documentation** enables reproducibility
4. **Evidence-based approach** builds confidence in decisions

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Earlier structure compliance** - Should have created proper folders at task inception
2. **Incremental validation** - Could validate sections as they're created
3. **Automated checks** - Could automate some compliance verification

### Key Learnings

1. Follow TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md from the start
2. Code-change-planner format is highly effective for implementation guidance
3. Comprehensive appendices significantly improve usability
4. Explicit MCP preservation constraints prevent scope creep
5. Evidence quality is critical for validation confidence
