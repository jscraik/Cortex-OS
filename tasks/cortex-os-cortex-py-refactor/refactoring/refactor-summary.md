# TDD Plan Refactoring Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Task**: Refactor cortex-os-&-cortex-py-tdd-plan.md to align with code-change-planner format  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

---

## Objectives

Refactor the existing TDD plan to:
1. Match the code-change-planner.prompt.md format structure
2. Preserve existing MCP server architecture (no changes to server)
3. Follow AGENTS.md governance and workflow requirements
4. Align with actual repository layout and file structure
5. Provide comprehensive implementation guidance

---

## Changes Made

### Structural Reorganization

**Before** (Original Plan):
- Sections organized by development phase chronologically
- Mixed implementation details with status updates
- Limited file tree visibility
- Technical rationale scattered throughout phases

**After** (Refactored Plan):
1. **File Tree of Proposed Changes** - Clear ASCII tree with NEW/UPDATE annotations
2. **Implementation Plan** - High-level summary with brAInwav standards
3. **Technical Rationale** - Architectural decisions and trade-offs consolidated
4. **Dependency Impact** - Internal/external dependencies and configuration changes
5. **Risks & Mitigations** - Technical, process, and security risks with mitigation strategies
6. **Testing & Validation Strategy** - Comprehensive test organization and validation checkpoints
7. **Rollout / Migration Notes** - Feature flags, migration steps, cleanup plan
8. **Completion Criteria** - Phase-specific and repository-wide success criteria
9. **Phase Implementation Details** - Detailed execution for each phase
10. **Success Metrics & Current Status** - Quality gates and progress tracking
11. **Appendices** - Quick reference commands, compliance checklist, governance references, acceptance tests, task folder structure

### Key Improvements

#### 1. File Tree Clarity
```
âœ… Added comprehensive ASCII tree showing all affected files
âœ… Clear annotations (NEW vs UPDATE) for each file
âœ… Organized by package structure matching repository layout
âœ… Included test files, documentation, and infrastructure changes
```

#### 2. Code-Change-Planner Alignment
```
âœ… Section 1: File Tree (with NEW/UPDATE/DELETE tags)
âœ… Section 2: Implementation Plan (step-by-step directive style)
âœ… Section 3: Technical Rationale (architectural decisions)
âœ… Section 4: Dependency Impact (internal + external packages)
âœ… Section 5: Risks & Mitigations (with concrete examples)
âœ… Section 6: Testing Strategy (fixtures, mocks, validation)
âœ… Section 7: Rollout Notes (feature flags, migration, cleanup)
âœ… Section 8: Completion Criteria (checklist format)
```

#### 3. AGENTS.md Compliance
```
âœ… References to Governance Pack (Vision, Workflow, RULES_OF_AI, Constitution)
âœ… Template compliance (Feature Spec, Research, TDD Plan)
âœ… Task folder structure alignment (research/, verification/, design/, etc.)
âœ… Quality gate enforcement (â‰¥90% coverage, mutation testing)
âœ… brAInwav branding requirements documented
âœ… MCP preservation explicitly stated
```

#### 4. CODESTYLE.md Integration
```
âœ… Functions â‰¤40 lines requirement emphasized
âœ… Named exports only (zero default exports)
âœ… Functional-first patterns documented
âœ… TypeScript/Python naming conventions specified
âœ… Guard clauses for error handling
âœ… async/await pattern enforcement
```

#### 5. Implementation Guidance
```
âœ… Per-phase file changes with code examples
âœ… Evidence links (test files, baseline reports)
âœ… TDD cycle documentation (red-green-refactor)
âœ… Performance benchmarks specified
âœ… Security validation steps included
```

### Content Preservation

**Preserved from Original**:
- All phase completion statuses (âœ… COMPLETED, ðŸ”„ PLANNED)
- Existing test evidence and baseline metrics
- Current coverage numbers (85% line / 80.75% branch)
- Implementation details for Phases 0-3
- Future phase descriptions for Phases 4-9
- brAInwav development standards
- Acceptance test matrix

**Enhanced**:
- More detailed file-level changes with code snippets
- Explicit MCP preservation constraints
- Comprehensive risk analysis
- Structured testing strategy
- Clear rollback procedures
- Task folder structure mapping

## Validation

### Structure Validation
```bash
âœ… Sections 1-8 follow code-change-planner format
âœ… All mandatory sections present and complete
âœ… Appendices provide comprehensive reference material
âœ… File tree matches actual repository structure
```

### Governance Alignment
```bash
âœ… References Governance Pack documents
âœ… Follows task folder structure requirements
âœ… Includes code review checklist criteria
âœ… Documents memory persistence requirements
âœ… Aligns with Constitutional decision process
```

### Technical Accuracy
```bash
âœ… File paths verified against repository layout
âœ… MCP server preservation explicitly documented
âœ… brAInwav memory stack (Qdrant) correctly referenced
âœ… Coverage baseline accurately reported (85%/80.75%)
âœ… Test file locations match package structure
```
