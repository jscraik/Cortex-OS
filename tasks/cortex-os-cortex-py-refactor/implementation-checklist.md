## Notes

### Key Decisions

1. **MCP Preservation**: Server architecture unchanged per user requirements
2. **Coverage Ratcheting**: Start at 85%, ramp to 95% over 4 weeks
3. **Task Structure**: Proper folder organization per TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md
4. **Format Alignment**: Full code-change-planner compliance

### Blockers & Resolutions

- **B1**: Flat task file structure ‚Üí Resolved by creating proper folders
- **B2**: Format mismatch ‚Üí Resolved by refactoring to 8 sections + appendices
- **B3**: Missing annotations ‚Üí Resolved by adding NEW/UPDATE tags

### Next Actions

1. Create implementation-log.md for real-time tracking
2. Populate design/ with architecture diagrams
3. Begin Phase 4 when capacity allows
4. Continue coverage enhancement efforts
