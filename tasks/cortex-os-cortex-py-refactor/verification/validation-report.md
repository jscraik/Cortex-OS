✅ scripts/ci/
✅ tests/quality-gates/
✅ tests/tdd-coach/
✅ reports/baseline/
✅ docs/development/
✅ docs/runbooks/
```

**File Tree Accuracy**:
- All 45 documented file changes reference valid paths
- Package structure matches actual repository layout
- Test file locations follow co-location patterns
- Documentation paths align with standards

- ✅ Line coverage: 85.0% (correctly reported)
- ✅ Branch coverage: 80.75% (correctly reported)
- ✅ Target: 95/95 (aligned with quality gates)
- ✅ Source: `reports/baseline/summary.json`

### MCP Architecture Preservation

**Verification**:
- ✅ Explicitly stated: "Preserve existing MCP server configuration unchanged"
- ✅ Section 2: "MCP Preservation: Do not modify existing MCP server architecture"
- ✅ Section 3: "Existing MCP server configuration remains untouched per user requirements"
- ✅ Phase 1.2: "Preserved Node MCP server unchanged per requirements"

## Risk Analysis Quality

### Risk Coverage Assessment

**Technical Risks** (4/4 categories):
- ✅ REST Migration Breaking Flows - Integration tests mitigation
- ✅ Coverage Plateau - Gradual ramp strategy
- ✅ Performance Regression - <10ms latency budget
- ✅ Multimodal Timeout - asyncio.wait_for enforcement

**Process Risks** (2/2 categories):
- ✅ Scope Creep - MCP preservation constraint
- ✅ Documentation Drift - Mandatory Phase 7 updates

**Security Risks** (2/2 categories):
- ✅ Secrets Exposure - Zero secrets in task folders
- ✅ Injection Vulnerabilities - Zod validation + fuzzing

**Risk Analysis Quality**: COMPREHENSIVE - All major domains covered with concrete mitigations

---

## Testing Strategy Quality

### Test Organization (3/3 locations)

- ✅ **Co-located**: `packages/*/tests/` for unit tests
- ✅ **Root**: `tests/` for cross-package integration
- ✅ **Python**: `apps/cortex-py/tests/` for Python-specific

### Coverage Strategy (4/4 phases)

- ✅ **Week 1**: New code 100% coverage required
- ✅ **Week 2**: Target low-coverage existing files
- ✅ **Week 3**: Edge cases and error paths
- ✅ **Week 4**: Property-based and mutation testing

### Mock Policy (2/2 rules)

- ✅ **RED-factor only**: Tests tagged `[RED]` may use mocks
- ✅ **Live integrations**: All other tests use real components
