# SUMMARY â€“ OpenAI Agents Integration (brAInwav)

- Research, implementation plan, and TDD created per AGENTS.md workflow.
- Minimal adapters added (JS/Python) with brAInwav-branded errors; no network calls in tests.
- pyproject optional extras for agents; JS kept dependency-light pending package verification.
- Next: persist LocalMemoryEntryId, run pnpm ci:governance && pnpm ci:memory:enforce, then PR.
