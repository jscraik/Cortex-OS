# skills-registry-v1 — Summary

**Objective**: Establish a first-class, machine-validated skills registry (`Skills.md` schema) with supporting tooling, CLI/API surfaces, CI enforcement, and orchestrator integration.

## Key Outcomes
- ADR capturing decision to formalize skills metadata via `packages/skills-schema` and brAInwav governance.
- Unified schema + loader powering CLI, API, and orchestrator enforcement behind `CORTEX_SKILLS_REGISTRY_V1`.
- Contributor tooling: lint CLI, documentation guide, canonical `SendEmail` skill, generated catalogue.
- CI enhancements covering linting, typechecking, testing, coverage, mutation, and security gates for skills artifacts.
- Observability improvements emitting MCP audit events for skill invocation.

## Evidence Plan
- PrefLight logs (connectors, vibe checks) saved under `logs/`.
- Test runs and coverage archived in `test-logs/` & `verification/`.
- Concurrency strategy recorded in `json/concurrency-report.json`.
- Summary and checklist updated throughout execution; final state mirrored in PR description with citations.

## Next Actions
1. Socialize plan with maintainers; secure ADR number allocation (`ADR-00xx`).
2. Kick off TDD workflow following tasks outlined in `implementation-plan.md`.
3. Update `tasks/skills-system-integration` documents to reference this registry initiative (see repo updates).
4. Coordinate rollout timeline for feature flag enablement across staging → production.
