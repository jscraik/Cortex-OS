## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **@brainwav/telemetry Package**: Vendor-neutral telemetry emitter with privacy-first redaction
2. **AgentEvent Schema**: JSON Schema + TypeScript types for structured event data
3. **A2A Integration**: Schema registration and event topic management  
4. **Orchestration Bridge**: Maps LangGraph workflow events to structured telemetry
5. **Runtime Instrumentation**: Tool invocation lifecycle tracking

### Key Design Decisions
- **Vendor-neutral schema** for maximum flexibility and future platform integration
- **Privacy-first redaction** with configurable filters removing sensitive data
- **Bridge pattern** for orchestration events maintaining clean separation of concerns  
- **A2A event system** integration for real-time telemetry distribution
- **brAInwav branding** consistently applied throughout all outputs and error messages

## Quality Standards Compliance

### Constitutional Requirements
- âœ… Functions â‰¤40 lines (strictly enforced)
- âœ… Named exports only (no default exports)
- âœ… brAInwav branding in all outputs and errors
- âœ… No mock/placeholder code in production paths
- âœ… Privacy-first redaction by design
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (â‰¥95% changed lines)

### PRP Gate Alignment
- **G0 (Ideation)**: Blueprint complete with constitutional compliance
- **G1 (Architecture)**: Policy compliance tracked in research phase  
- **G2 (Test Plan)**: TDD plan fulfills test planning requirements
- **G4 (Verification)**: Quality gates aligned with G4 validation
- **Evidence Trail**: All artifacts linked in task documentation

## Implementation Readiness

### Prerequisites Met
- [x] Research document understanding (referenced in plan)
- [x] Approach selected and approved (vendor-neutral schema)
- [x] PRP G1 architecture policies reviewed
- [x] Internal dependencies identified (@cortex-os/a2a, @cortex-os/orchestration)
- [x] External dependencies minimal (Zod already present)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Schema drift**: Automated compatibility tests planned
- **Performance overhead**: Lightweight emission design  
- **Data leakage**: Mandatory redaction with safe defaults
- **Lifecycle leaks**: Proper cleanup in bridge stop() methods

## Expected Outcomes

### Functional Capabilities
1. **Structured Event Emission**: AgentEvent objects published to A2A topics
2. **Privacy Protection**: Sensitive data redacted before transmission
3. **Orchestration Tracking**: Plan creation, routing, and coordination events
4. **Tool Instrumentation**: MCP tool invocation lifecycle monitoring
5. **Error Context**: brAInwav-branded error handling throughout

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: â‰¥95% on changed lines, â‰¥90% global
- **Performance**: <10ms P95 telemetry emission latency
- **Security**: Zero high/critical findings in security scans
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance (if UI components)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Implementation Execution
1. **Begin RED Phase**: Execute checklist items 1-6 to write failing tests
2. **Verify RED State**: All telemetry tests failing as expected
3. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
4. **REFACTOR Phase**: Code quality improvements while maintaining GREEN
5. **Integration**: Documentation, quality gates, and final polish

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1 (RED)**: 0.5 days - Write comprehensive failing tests
- **Phase 2 (GREEN)**: 1.5 days - Minimal implementation to pass tests  
- **Phase 3 (REFACTOR)**: 0.5 days - Code quality and optimization
- **Phase 4-6**: 1 day - Integration, documentation, quality gates
- **Total**: 3-4 days for complete implementation

## Evidence and Traceability

### Documentation Chain
- Planning artifacts stored in `tasks/structured-telemetry-implementation/`
- Implementation evidence will be tracked in test logs and verification reports
- Architectural decisions documented for future agent learning
- Local Memory integration for decision persistence

### CI/CD Integration
- Conventional commits with brAInwav co-authorship
- Quality gates: lint, typecheck, test, security scan, structure validation
- Evidence tokens for phase transitions and compliance verification
- Coverage reporting with enforcement profile alignment
