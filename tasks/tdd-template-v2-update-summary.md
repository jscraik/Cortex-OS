#### Phase 4: Contract Tests
- Service APIs (consumer + provider)
- Schema validation and evolution
- Backward compatibility testing

#### Phase 10: Performance & Load Tests
- k6, Locust, or appropriate tool
- P95 latency SLO verification
- Sustained load (30+ minutes)
- Horizontal scaling validation

#### Phase 11: Chaos & Fault Injection
