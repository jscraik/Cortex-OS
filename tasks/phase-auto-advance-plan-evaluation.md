# Phase Auto-Advance Plan Evaluation

## Context
The existing GPU acceleration memory safety plan already defines the scoped work for the current task. The additional proposal for `scripts/phase/auto-advance.js` targets a different subsystem (the governance automation CLI) with its own TDD artifact.

## Decision
Do **not** include the auto-advance script changes in the current implementation plan.

## Rationale
- The task charter focuses on GPU memory safety improvements inside `packages/memory-core`. Expanding scope to CLI phase automation violates the "no scope creep" directive in root `AGENTS.md` (ยง2 and ยง6) and the previously approved plan.
- The proposed script edits rely on a distinct TDD plan (`tasks/phase-auto-advance-log-fix-tdd-plan.md`) that is not part of the current governance approvals. Merging both plans would blur accountability and complicate evidence tracking.
- Keeping the workstreams separate maintains clean traceability for reviewers and aligns with the Agentic Phase Policy's requirement that each plan maps to a single, well-bounded change set.

## Follow-up
If the auto-advance logging fix is still desired, schedule it as a dedicated task referencing its TDD plan and pursue it independently from the GPU acceleration effort.
