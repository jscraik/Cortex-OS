## OpenAI Apps SDK Implementation Guide

This guide distills the core steps for building, testing, and shipping ChatGPT Apps with the OpenAI Apps SDK. Use it alongside the official documentation when planning features or reviewing pull requests.

### 1. Understand the MCP foundation

- Apps SDK apps are powered by an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lists tools, handles `call_tool` requests, and can return structured UI payloads. Treat MCP as the contract between ChatGPT, your backend, and any custom components you return. citeturn0search4

### 2. Plan your experience

- Start by mapping key use cases, whether users need inline vs. fullscreen components, and how state should persist across turns. Early sketches ensure the MCP payloads (HTML/components) expose the right fields. citeturn0search7
- Assemble a “golden prompt” set (direct, indirect, negative prompts) to evaluate metadata and discovery from day one. citeturn0search2

### 3. Build the MCP server

- Implement list and call handlers for each tool; ensure JSON Schema definitions precisely describe inputs/outputs. citeturn0search4
- Expose your server at a stable `/mcp` endpoint that supports streaming responses. citeturn0search5

### 4. Design high-quality metadata

- Name tools with `domain.action`, begin descriptions with “Use this when…”, call out disallowed cases, and leverage enums for constrained params.
- Iterate metadata using your prompt set, tracking precision/recall, and adjust descriptions before launch. citeturn0search2

### 5. Secure and authenticate

- Follow least-privilege principles; request only the scopes you need and surface write actions for explicit confirmation.
- For external systems, integrate OAuth 2.1 with PKCE per the Apps SDK auth guidance. citeturn0search6turn0search8

### 6. Test thoroughly

- Unit-test tool handlers (schema validation, edge cases, auth flows).
- Use the MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest`) to probe requests/responses during development. citeturn0search3

### 7. Deploy and monitor

- Host the MCP server on a reliable HTTPS platform (managed containers, serverless, or Kubernetes) and keep `/mcp` responsive.
- During development, use tunnels (e.g., ngrok) to expose local servers.
- After launch, monitor tool-call analytics and rerun prompt regressions to catch metadata drift. citeturn0search5turn0search2

### 8. Comply with developer guidelines

- Ensure the app is safe for a broad audience, owns the IP it exposes, provides accurate metadata, and includes responsive support details.
- Be ready for review cycles—tool names, signatures, and descriptions are locked post-approval, so plan updates carefully. citeturn0search1

### 9. Checklist for launch readiness

1. **Use case + component plan** drafted and validated with stakeholders. citeturn0search7  
2. **MCP server** exposes tools with precise JSON Schemas and handles errors gracefully. citeturn0search4  
3. **Authentication & security** audited (least privilege, consent flows, logging, retention). citeturn0search6turn0search8  
4. **Metadata** iterated with golden prompts; metrics meeting precision/recall targets. citeturn0search2  
5. **Automated + inspector testing** completed; manual runbooks captured. citeturn0search3  
6. **Deployment** plan finalized (hosting, monitoring, rollback strategy). citeturn0search5  
7. **Policy compliance** confirmed via developer guidelines checklist. citeturn0search1
