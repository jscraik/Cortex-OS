# MCP Pieces Integration - Implementation Log

## 2025-10-10: Task Structure Created

### Actions Taken

1. **Created Task Folder Structure**
   - Created `~/tasks/mcp-pieces-integration/` following AGENTS.md guidelines
   - Organized according to `.cortex/rules/TASK_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`
   - All required subfolders and files in place

2. **Refactored Implementation Plan**
   - Original plan: `tasks/mcp-and-memory-tdd-plan.md` (format mismatch)
   - New plan: `implementation-plan.md` (code-change-planner format compliant)
   - Key changes:
     - Followed 8-section mandatory format
     - Works WITH existing MCP setup (not against it)
     - Clear file trees showing NEW/UPDATE actions
     - Realistic 14-day timeline
     - Comprehensive risk analysis

3. **Created Research Documentation**
   - File: `research.md`
   - RAID analysis completed
   - Feasibility study (PIECES) documented
   - Architecture choices identified
   - Existing patterns documented

4. **Created TDD Plan**
   - File: `tdd-plan.md`
   - BDD acceptance scenarios defined
   - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles planned
   - Test coverage goals set (â‰¥95%)
   - Mocking strategy documented

5. **Created Implementation Checklist**
   - File: `implementation-checklist.md`
   - 150+ actionable checklist items
   - Organized by phase (8 phases)
   - Day-by-day breakdown
   - Clear verification steps

### Decisions Made

1. **Task Naming**: `mcp-pieces-integration` (descriptive kebab-case slug)
2. **Scope**: Focus on completing Pieces integration (Drive, Copilot, enhanced search, bridge, reporting)
3. **Approach**: Work with existing MCP infrastructure, additive changes only
4. **Timeline**: 14 days estimated (realistic based on complexity)

### Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Pieces Drive Proxy implementation
2. Follow TDD plan strictly (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
3. Update implementation-checklist.md as items complete
4. Document challenges in this log
5. Store architectural decisions in research.md

### Status

- **Phase**: 0 (Planning) - COMPLETE
- **Next Phase**: 1 (Drive Proxy Implementation)
- **Confidence**: High (clear plan, existing patterns)
- **Blockers**: None
