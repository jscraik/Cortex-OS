## 🚨 CRITICAL: brAInwav Production Standards

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER claim any implementation is "production-ready", "complete", "operational", or "fully implemented" if it contains:

- `Math.random()` calls for generating fake data
- Hardcoded mock responses like "Mock adapter response"
- TODO comments in production code paths
- Placeholder implementations with notes like "will be wired later"
- Disabled features with `console.warn("not implemented")`
- Fake system metrics or data generation

**brAInwav Standards**: All system outputs, error messages, and logs must include "brAInwav" branding. Status claims must be verified against actual code implementation.

**Reference**: See `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/.cortex/rules/RULES_OF_AI.md` for complete production standards.

This crate defines the "types" for the protocol used by Codex CLI, which includes both "internal types" for communication between `codex-core` and `codex-tui`, as well as "external types" used with `codex mcp`.

This crate should have minimal dependencies.

Ideally, we should avoid "material business logic" in this crate, as we can always introduce `Ext`-style traits to add functionality to types in other crates.
