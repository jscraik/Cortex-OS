# Changelog

> **⚠️ HISTORICAL NOTE**: This changelog contains references to deleted apps (`apps/api`, `cortex-marketplace`,
`cortex-marketplace-api`, `cortex-webui`) which were removed from the codebase in October 2025.
Historical entries have been preserved for reference.

All notable changes to brAInwav Cortex-OS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### Test Quality Improvements (2025-01-22)

- **Improved Test Mock Pattern in http-surface.test.ts**:
  - Replaced stub return value with fail-fast error throwing in self-rag test mock
  - Changed mock from returning 'Should not be called' to throwing explicit error
  - Error message: "graph.query should not be called in self-rag mode"
  - Removed unnecessary `satisfies GraphRagResult` type assertion
  - Follows TypeScript and Vitest best practices for test mocks
  
- **Benefits**:
  - Tests fail immediately with clear error if mock is unexpectedly called
  - Makes test intent explicit and easier to understand
  - Improves debuggability for future maintainers
  - Minimal change: 3 lines added, 6 lines removed

**Impact**: Enhanced test quality and maintainability following brAInwav testing standards. Test continues to validate that graph.query is not called in self-rag mode, but now fails fast with descriptive error if this contract is violated.

### Security

#### CVE-2025-57319 (fast-redact) Fixed - Zero Vulnerabilities Achieved (2025-01-21)

- **Vulnerability Remediation**: Resolved prototype pollution vulnerability in fast-redact@3.5.0
  - Updated `pino` from v8.x/v9.x to v10.0.0 across 14 packages
  - Implemented pnpm overrides to force `pino@>=10.0.0` globally
  - Replaced `fast-redact` with `slow-redact` via override mechanism
  - Fixed transitive dependency chain: fastify→pino→fast-redact

- **Package Updates**:
  - Root `package.json`: pino ^9.11.0 → ^10.0.0
  - Updated pino in: agents, observability, orchestration, registry, mcp-server, security, cortex-logging, mvp-core, memories, memory-core, memory-rest-api, local-memory, evidence/analytics
  - @pact-foundation/pact: ^12.2.0 → ^15.0.1 (packages/gateway)

- **pnpm Overrides Added**:

  ```json
  {
    "pino": ">=10.0.0",
    "fast-redact": "npm:slow-redact@latest"
  }
  ```

- **Verification**:
  - `pnpm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities (previously 1 low severity)
  - Total dependencies: 3,947
  - fast-redact completely removed from dependency tree
  - slow-redact successfully deployed as replacement

- **Security Scanning**:
  - Secret scanning: No secrets detected
  - Code scanning: Semgrep configured in CI/CD (OWASP, LLM, MITRE ATLAS rulesets)

**Impact**: Achieved zero known vulnerabilities across entire dependency tree. Established pnpm override pattern for future security enforcement. All brAInwav security standards maintained.

**Reference**: See `SECURITY_FIXES_REPORT.md` for comprehensive documentation.

### Added

#### 1Password Environment Loader Integration (2025-02-06)

- Introduced a shared dotenv loader (`scripts/utils/dotenv-loader.mjs`) to prevent draining 1Password FIFO secrets and emit `[brAInwav]` diagnostics.
- Exposed TypeScript-friendly wrapper via `@cortex-os/utils` so services can `await loadDotenv()` without duplicating logic.
- Updated GitHub automation packages (`cortex-ai-github`, `cortex-semgrep-github`,
  `cortex-structure-github`) to use the shared helper with branded logging.
- Added Vitest coverage under `tests/tools/dotenv-loader.test.ts` validating candidate order, FIFO handling, and wrapper delegation.
- Documented operational guidance in `docs/development/1password-env.md` and linked from the top-level README.

#### brAInwav Policy Enforcement Pack (2025-01-21)

- **Semgrep Rule Pack**: 10 production-grade rules in `semgrep/brainwav.yml`
  - Production code prohibitions: Math.random(), mock responses, TODO comments, "not implemented" warnings
  - brAInwav branding enforcement: [brAInwav] prefix in logs, errors, prompts
  - Development hygiene: Smart Nx wrapper enforcement, no interactive prompts in CI
  - Agent-toolkit requirement: Mandate @cortex-os/agent-toolkit for unified tooling
  - MCP port drift detection: Track configuration changes
  
- **AST-Grep Rule Pack**: 3 auto-fixable rules in `ast-grep/brainwav.yml`
  - `brand-in-throw`: Ensure `throw new Error()` includes [brAInwav] prefix
  - `brand-in-logger`: Ensure console.log/error/warn includes [brAInwav] prefix
  - `no-not-implemented-warn`: Convert console.warn("not implemented") to throws
  - Auto-fix support via `pnpm lint:ast-grep:fix`

- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow `security-modern.yml`
  - New `brainwav-policy` job with diff-based Semgrep scanning
  - Automatic PR comments with first 10 violations + summary
  - AST-Grep validation with artifact uploads (30-day retention)
  - Baseline comparison for incremental policy enforcement

- **Development Tooling**:
  - `scripts/guard-nx-smart.sh`: Pre-commit guard preventing raw `nx run-many` usage
  - `tools/agent-checks/brainwavChecks.ts`: Agent-toolkit integration for prohibition scanning
  - 5 new package.json scripts: `security:scan:brainwav*`, `lint:ast-grep:*`
  - `.husky/pre-commit` updated with AST-Grep soft-fail checks

- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/brainwav-policy-pack.md`: Comprehensive guide with usage examples
  - `examples/policy-violations.example.ts`: Demonstration file with violations and correct patterns
  - Updated `.semgrepignore` with test/docs exclusions

**Impact**: Automated enforcement of brAInwav production standards preventing placeholder implementations,
ensuring brand consistency, and mandating Smart Nx wrapper usage across the monorepo.
