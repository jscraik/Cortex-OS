- Packages with proper excludes: ~80%
- Overall conformance rate: 88%
```

### Task Progress

- Task: `typescript-project-structure-cleanup`
- Phase 1: Quick Fix ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Phase 2: Standardization ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Phase 3: Project References (Future - full cross-package compilation)

### Fixed

#### TypeScript Configuration Cleanup - Phase 1 (2025-01-09)

- **Fixed TypeScript compilation configuration errors in gateway packages**
  - Resolved tsconfig issues in `@cortex-os/model-gateway` (packages/services/model-gateway)
  - Resolved tsconfig issues in `@cortex-os/gateway` (packages/gateway)
  - **Note**: Original configurations were already failing with TS6059 cross-package import errors
  - Phase 1 focuses on local tsconfig correctness; full build requires Phase 3 (project references)
  
- **packages/services/model-gateway/tsconfig.json**:
  - Removed restrictive `rootDir: "src"` that conflicted with `tests/**/*` in include
  - Added `composite: true` for buildable library support (was missing)
  - Added `noEmit: false` for declaration generation
  - Updated include to only cover `src/**/*` (removed tests from main config)
  - Added comprehensive exclude array (dist, node_modules, test files)
  
- **packages/gateway/tsconfig.json**:
  - Maintained `rootDir: "src"` to preserve `dist/server.js` output layout for start script
  - Removed `scripts` from include array (scripts/*.cjs don't need TypeScript compilation)
  - Added `scripts/**/*` to exclude array for clarity
  - Added exclude array for test files and build outputs  
  - Kept `composite: true` for project references (was already present)
  - **Impact**: Dist layout remains stable - `pnpm start` expects `dist/server.js` unchanged

- **packages/services/model-gateway/tsconfig.spec.json** (new):
  - Created separate test configuration extending main tsconfig
  - Includes `tests/**/*` and `src/**/*.test.ts`
  - Uses `dist-spec` outDir to avoid conflicts with production build
  - Configured for vitest with appropriate types
  - Follows brAInwav best practice: separate test/production configs

### Testing

**tests/scripts/typescript-config.test.ts** (new):
- Phase 1 validation suite for TypeScript configurations
- Tests composite flag, outDir consistency, include/exclude correctness
- Validates no local rootDir conflicts in tsconfig files
- 15 tests passing, 9 deferred to Phase 3 (project references)
- Ensures configurations remain brAInwav compliant

### Documentation

**docs/troubleshooting/typescript-config.md** (new):
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for TypeScript config errors
- Covers TS6059 (rootDir), TS5056 (overwrite), TS6307 (project refs)
- Documents brAInwav TypeScript standards
- Includes quick fixes and best practices
- Phase implementation status tracking

**CHANGELOG.md** (this file):
- Documented all Phase 1 changes with technical details
- Listed affected files and specific changes made
- Clarified Phase 3 requirement for cross-package compilation
- Noted dist layout stability in gateway package

### Impact & Scope

- ✅ Local tsconfig configurations corrected (no rootDir conflicts)
- ✅ Packages follow brAInwav TypeScript standards (composite, outDir, proper excludes)
- ✅ Test infrastructure validates configuration correctness
- ✅ Foundation for Phase 2 (standardization) and Phase 3 (project references) established
- ✅ Dist output layout preserved (gateway: `dist/server.js` maintained for start script)
- ⚠️  **Cross-package TypeScript compilation** (TS6059/TS6307 errors from imports) requires Phase 3 project references
- ⚠️  These packages were **already failing** with cross-package errors before Phase 1 changes

**Original Problem**: The original issue wasn't local rootDir conflicts - it was cross-package dependencies pulling in files from other workspaces, which TypeScript tries to compile without proper project references. Phase 1 fixes the local configuration correctness; Phase 3 will add project references to resolve cross-package compilation.

### Task Progress

- Task: `typescript-project-structure-cleanup`
- Phase 1: Quick Fix ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Phase 2: Standardization (Next - templates, migration, validation)
- Phase 3: Project References (Future - full cross-package compilation)

### Added

#### 1Password Environment Loader Integration (2025-02-06)

- Introduced a shared dotenv loader (`scripts/utils/dotenv-loader.mjs`) to prevent draining 1Password FIFO secrets and emit `[brAInwav]` diagnostics.
- Exposed TypeScript-friendly wrapper via `@cortex-os/utils` so services can `await loadDotenv()` without duplicating logic.
- Updated GitHub automation packages (`cortex-ai-github`, `cortex-semgrep-github`,
  `cortex-structure-github`) to use the shared helper with branded logging.
- Added Vitest coverage under `tests/tools/dotenv-loader.test.ts` validating candidate order, FIFO handling, and wrapper delegation.
- Documented operational guidance in `docs/development/1password-env.md` and linked from the top-level README.

  - Development hygiene: Smart Nx wrapper enforcement, no interactive prompts in CI
  - Agent-toolkit requirement: Mandate @cortex-os/agent-toolkit for unified tooling
  - MCP port drift detection: Track configuration changes
  
- **AST-Grep Rule Pack**: 3 auto-fixable rules in `ast-grep/brainwav.yml`
